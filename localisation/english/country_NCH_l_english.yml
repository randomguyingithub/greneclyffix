### FOCUSES ###
# Pre crisis #

NCH_legacy:0 "Enya’s Legacy"
NCH_legacy_desc:0 "The glorious Queen Enya of Oir left us last year, plunging the nation into an age of steam engines, machinery, and railways. While the hives benefit greatly from these reforms, their drawbacks are not to be ignored... "

NCH_divided_house:0 "A House Divided"
NCH_divided_house_desc:0 "Although Gytha was prepared to become a monarch from a young age.  Throughout her life she had rarely ventured beyond Blosmport. To witness life, alongside the conditions inside her hives with her own eyes, the Queen has decided to embark on a small tour of the island together with the High Judge to gain a clear understanding of the problems and desires the common drone endures."

NCH_parliament_convocation:0 "The Gathering of Eryahtas"
NCH_parliament_convocation_desc:0 "For centuries, the queens of Greneclyf have relied on an auxiliary governing body known as the Eryahtas. Despite it’s close intertwinement with the Church, it’s what the Griffon Continent would call a parliament. The time has come to hold the first gathering of this representative body under the new queen. Here, they will decide what future awaits the country, at least for the coming years."

NCH_Spy_experience:0 "Study Fresh Agent Experience"
NCH_Spy_experience_desc:0 "In the 70s, Enya introduced the practice of embedding our citizens within the societies of various Griffonian states, allowing them to study at local universities and gather information about the outside world. Just before her death, another group of graduates returned.  Now, their experience must be put to use in the development of the kingdom."

NCH_new_housing:0 "New Housing?"
NCH_new_housing_desc:0 "Overpopulation has created an unforeseen problem: our citizens lack space in the hive-cities. We have neither the resources nor the time to construct an entirely new hive, but one graduate of Aquila’s architectural faculty has an intriguing proposal..."

NCH_find_they_job:0 "Find Them Jobs!"
NCH_find_they_job_desc:0 "Faced with two problems—education and unemployment—some economists have concluded that a mutually beneficial solution exists: redirecting the unemployed toward the construction of schools on the outskirts of Bugsmere and Blosmport. If successful, this experiment will mark the first step toward the island’s urbanization and the resolution of unemployment."

NCH_lift_the_veil:0 "Lift the Veil"
NCH_lift_the_veil_desc:0 "Eight hundred years ago, we signed the Great Agreements with Farbrook, and it seems the trading season has come once again. However, after Enya’s modernization, it appears the fishers have little to offer us beyond—well—fish. Hopefully, Tselkhelm will not take offense at the reduced enthusiasm of our merchants."

NCH_learn_from_mistakes:0 "Lessons Learned"
NCH_learn_from_mistakes_desc:0 "One of the greatest problems of Enya’s reforms was leaving smaller communities behind. This not only added to the current crisis but also left many social norms unable to adapt to the present. Prefect Carrion has proposed organizing the ‘National Rebirth Movement,’ aimed at retraining our citizens and shedding habits of the old order. He argues that our former society was not truly national, but communal. "

NCH_typography:0 "Open the Printing House"
NCH_typography_desc:0 "Greneclyf has never had a standardized printing house. Even during Enya’s era of change, information was treated as something military or aristocratic, rather than popular. As a result, soldiers relay information via telegraphs, while civilians cannot even learn the latest news. We should remedy this."

NCH_take_look_around:0 "Look Around"
NCH_take_look_around_desc:0 "Surprisingly, the River Coalition is unaware of our existence! Despite only being a strait away, rough waters and dark rumors have long deterred ponies from exploring the north. By masquerading as Farbrook residents and prospectors, our merchants, Our merchants may gain access to their markets. However caution is advised. The local ponies are hardly ready to encounter a changeling in their natural form."

NCH_Esteblish_trade_guild:0 "Establish the Trade Guild"
NCH_Esteblish_trade_guild_desc:0 "The days when our trade relied solely on craftsmen and enthusiasts are over—now it is dominated by manufactory owners and major ‘capitalists,’ as they are called on the Griffon Continent. To better coordinate this wealthy stratum and direct their activity in service of the kingdom, Gytha and the Eryahtas have decided to establish a Trade Guild and introduce a universal registry for enterprises."

NCH_time_to_look_further:0 "Time to Look Further"
NCH_time_to_look_further_desc:0 "Her Majesty Gytha has worked diligently to resolve the primary issues of the kingdom she inherited. Well then—it is time to look further and see how the state of affairs stands."


# Crisis #
NCH_beginning_of_crisis:0 "What Cannot Be Avoided"
NCH_beginning_of_crisis_desc:0 "It has happened again. The Second Great Famine has swept over us like a crushing wave, and dark clouds have gathered over the island. May the Matron save us..."

NCH_to_neighbors:0 "The End of Hide and Seek"
NCH_to_neighbors_desc:0 "The situation forces Greneclyf to “show its face” far earlier than we had planned. We must not only ask our old friends from the hills for help but finally make ourselves known to the Coalition as well."

NCH_reguest_of_help:0 "Meeting with Trade Emissaries"
NCH_reguest_of_help_desc:0 "Representatives of the Coalition have shown restrained curiosity after meeting with our envoys. As a gesture of goodwill and the opening step toward negotiations for aid, the Queen herself wishes to meet them. Let us hope this leaves an impression."

NCH_army_concessions:0 "Saor SEZ"
NCH_army_concessions_desc:0 "The creation of the so-called Saor Special Economic Zone was one of the Coalition emissaries’ demands. Simply put, the river ponies will lease part of Aisling, building port enterprises at their own expense and developing business—assisting both our population and their own through a profitable trade hub. It sounds good on paper, but how will it work in practice?"

NCH_concessions_for_help:0 "Saor Police"
NCH_concessions_for_help_desc:0 "To maintain order in Saor, the United River Company has demanded the deployment of its own private police regiment. It seems only a financial threat would ever truly unite the river nations..."

NCH_every_friend:0 "Send an Envoy to Farbrook"
NCH_every_friend_desc:0 "The Queen has ordered an envoy to be sent to the Farbrook tribes. Despite their meager catch this year, our citizens remain in dire need not only of food, but also of love, something the hill ponies have provided us with since the signing of the Great Agreements."

NCH_hoof_of_help:0 "A Helping Hoof"
NCH_hoof_of_help_desc:0 "Farbrook is not the only community in the hills: reconnaissance has identified two others to the west—Rijekograd and the Fir Villages. It would be appropriate to offer them friendship, especially now, when our options are limited."

NCH_some_love:0 "Matters of Love"
NCH_some_love_desc:0 "Gytha has come up with a rather unconventional solution for acquiring more love for her homeland. Perhaps even too unconventional."

NCH_overvise_great_packt:0 "Revising the Great Agreements"
NCH_overvise_great_packt_desc:0 "Our old treaties with Farbrook are no longer sufficient in the modern world. Since we have opened our lands to the river nations, we should conclude new agreements to stay afloat amid the chaos of capitalism."

NCH_mre_cards:0 "Introduce Rations"
NCH_mre_cards_desc:0 "We must react swiftly. Vixit is clever, and she has already determined what must be done in the Grove—we will follow her example. An official system of food rations distributed by coupons is introduced throughout the kingdom, along with an evening curfew to prevent unrest."

NCH_limit_external_trade:0 "Expand Obsidian Exports"
NCH_limit_external_trade_desc:0 "Our island is rich in minerals, but especially abundant in volcanic glass—obsidian. Other countries do not know how to utilize this resource, which is why we will not only sell it, but also send our specialists abroad—experts capable of applying the use of obsidian in fields ranging from medicine to construction."

NCH_agroindustrial_mobilization:0 "New Agricultural Methods"
NCH_agroindustrial_mobilization_desc:0 "The Sacred Grove—our great breadbasket—has suffered as a result of a failed experiment by agrarians trained in the Evi Valley. To supply our citizens with bread as quickly as possible, we will import and plant resilient crops from the Riverlands. Baroness Vixit will spare no effort to accelerate the harvest."

NCH_modernization_industry:0 "Abandon the Gold Standard"
NCH_modernization_industry_desc:0 "During Enya’s reign, our currency was tied to the so-called gold standard. However, the experience of our agents and hired advisers shows that in the current situation—where Greneclyf’s economy is growing through anti-crisis mobilization—it is vital to peg the currency to GDP instead. Naturally, this process will proceed under strict supervision by the Treasury."

NCH_industrial_cooperatives:0 "The Royal Enya Institute"
NCH_industrial_cooperatives_desc:0 "We lack a broad base of educational reforms, but circumstances demand immediate action. By royal decree, the Queen announces the opening of the first two faculties of a future university—economics and natural sciences—within the grand building of Blosmport’s central library. This is our first necessary step toward forming a national intellectual elite."

NCH_agroindustrial_programs:0 "Distribution of Surpluses"
NCH_agroindustrial_programs_desc:0 "A small surplus has accumulated in the food reserves. We must distribute it among the population in a way that brings the kingdom maximum benefit under current conditions."

NCH_domestic_consumption:0 "Cover Domestic Consumption"
NCH_domestic_consumption_desc:0 "We endured. Gytha’s rule managed to confront the crisis and prevent famine at its inception, avoiding catastrophe. Now that the worst is behind us, it is time to address social issues that have unexpectedly surfaced amid the other challenges..."

NCH_emergacy_plan:0 "Emergency Measures"
NCH_emergacy_plan_desc:0 "Following an extraordinary gathering of the Eryahtas, a unanimous decision was made to declare a state of emergency nationwide, mobilize enterprises, and strengthen protection of the agro-industrial sector. Much work lies ahead."

NCH_call_for_unity:0 "Activate Propaganda"
NCH_call_for_unity_desc:0 "An urgent task has been found for Gagat’s printing house in these troubled times—to become a mouthpiece of stability and the Queen’s will. The newly formed Department of Information and Propaganda of our Chancellery will immediately begin shaping the narrative to calm the population, disseminating it through newspapers."

NCH_consolidation_political:0 "Secure the Support of the Church"
NCH_consolidation_political_desc:0 "A long-standing ally of the crown in Greneclyf is the Church of Lady Matron—the country’s oldest religious institution, formed shortly after the Lemann and Oir houses established the Athsholáthar Cothrom system of governance. In times of crisis, it is wise to seek assistance from Actino, the influential praetor of Blosmport."

NCH_clans_of_Greneclyf:0 "Impose Martial Law"
NCH_clans_of_Greneclyf_desc:0 "Radicals and the discontented are preparing to hold an unauthorized rally in the capital. Gytha has ordered Prefect Carrion to take defensive positions and prepare the troops. With her sanction, Oiren declares temporary martial law."

NCH_suppression_of_unrest:0 "Lance the Abscess"
NCH_suppression_of_unrest_desc:0 "According to a long-term investigation by our valiant Lord Protector and the secret service, an entire underground network of elements hostile to the crown is operating within the country, intent on unleashing a bloody civil war for power. To prevent brother from turning against brother, we must cleanse the nation of parasites."

NCH_final_crisis:0 "Clear Skies Over Greneclyf"
NCH_final_crisis_desc:0 "The famine has been halted, and son did not turn against father. Queen Gytha managed to save us from the Second Great Famine, but the crisis has forever changed both Greneclyf and the monarch herself. What the future holds remains unclear—but for now, we can finally breathe."


### MAINT PATCH ###
# Gytha reforms patch #
NCH_reforms_after_storm:0 "Continue Enya’s Path"
NCH_reforms_after_storm_desc:0 "With the crisis behind us, we cannot afford inaction. We must continue reforming the country to ensure that a situation like the one that nearly led to the Second Great Famine never happens again."

NCH_patch_to_prosperty:0 "Royal Decrees"
NCH_patch_to_prosperty_desc:0 "To address social issues, Oiren prepared and secured approval through the Eryahtas for the first package of post-crisis decrees. The Chancellery’s Department of Information and Propaganda will immediately publish them after the queen’s signature, spreading the news of further changes through Gagat’s printing house."

NCH_health_care_reform:0 "Mandatory Insurance"
NCH_health_care_reform_desc:0 "Every citizen of the kingdom must know that their life and health are protected. From now on, no worker will die in poverty, crushed by debts for medical care."

NCH_education_reform:0 "Eradication of Illiteracy"
NCH_education_reform_desc:0 "One of the main consequences of overpopulation is the lack of school places, especially in rural areas. The time has come to solve this problem by expanding existing schools and encouraging the creation of reading circles in libraries across the country."

NCH_civil_rights_reform:0 "Development of the North and South"
NCH_civil_rights_reform_desc:0 "We need new lands to relieve overcrowded regions. Vixit proposes large-scale urbanization projects in the Sacred Grove and Aisling, drawing on the experience of Zhukomir to avoid ecological damage. With consultations from Berilla and chief architect Valha, the plan should succeed."

NCH_blosmport_hive:0 "Opening of the Institute"
NCH_blosmport_hive_desc:0 "The Royal Enya Institute finally sheds its temporary status and becomes a full-fledged university with a wide range of faculties."

NCH_birth_control:0 "Birth Control"
NCH_birth_control_desc:0 "The larger the population, the better — but everything has its limits. Overpopulation has become a threat, and we must slow growth by introducing fines for the birth of a third and subsequent children. Unfortunately, this is a necessary measure."

NCH_new_instituts:0 "Cult of Progress"
NCH_new_instituts_desc:0 "We are destined to move only forward, into the future where our kingdom truly belongs. Our goal is to build a welfare state and cultivate progressive ideas throughout society."

NCH_traditional_way_of_life:0 "Social Conservatism"
NCH_traditional_way_of_life_desc:0 "The state must care for its citizens, but only a truly patriotic authority can do so. An official must not be a cosmopolitan — they are a national servant. Matrona, the law, and the nation itself guide society forward, not blind faith in abstract ideals."

NCH_first_constitution:0 "End of the Schism"
NCH_first_constitution_desc:0 "After the death of the last cardinal, the Church’s praetorium failed for ten years to agree on a new herald of Matrona. The three-way split dragged on for too long, and it is time to end these fruitless disputes. Royal prerogative will allow the appointment of a new cardinal and restore unity of faith."

NCH_from_chaos:0 "Benevolent Rule"
NCH_from_chaos_desc:0 "A monarch is responsible for their people. Gytha studied history, and one of the most instructive events on the continent was the revolution in the Griffonian Empire, which led to civil war and the fall of a hegemon. To avoid repeating these mistakes, we will begin a partial introduction of republican institutions into the monarchical system."

NCH_form_new_govermant:0 "Ideas of the Right"
NCH_form_new_govermant_desc:0 "Beakolini’s ideas may seem exotic, but they contain a rational core worth borrowing: the corporate organization of the state. We have no need for fascist aesthetics, but the lower chamber of the Eryahtas will now be formed from scholars, workers, and soldiers, while the upper chamber will become elective."

NCH_reflecting_the_past:0 "Ideas of the Left"
NCH_reflecting_the_past_desc:0 "After suppressing the Marksists, our state firmly embraced anti-communism, but excessive pressure could provoke unrest and revolution. To prevent social upheaval, we will establish a system of state trade unions and legally guarantee the eight-hour workday. No factory owner in Zhukomir will dare oppress workers again, and the demon of Marksism will whisper them no false hopes."

NCH_to_the_new_order:0 "The First Constitution"
NCH_to_the_new_order_desc:0 "After many years of preparation, Oiren has finally completed her work. We now have a draft of the first constitution of the Kingdom of Greneclyf. It is time to review its main provisions and approve this historic document."

NCH_save_clans_system:0 "Status Quo"
NCH_save_clans_system_desc:0 "A historic decision has been made to legally establish the monarch as the full head of the executive branch. The queen will always be able to choose the country’s path of development, while the Eryahtas will either support these changes or serve as a wise counterbalance."

NCH_hereditary_monarchy:0 "Scales and Scepter"
NCH_hereditary_monarchy_desc:0 "Gytha has made her decision. The Kingdom of Greneclyf will adopt the previously alien institution of prime ministers. The monarch will personally appoint the prime minister for a four-year term, and the queen already knows whom she will choose. It is time to announce her decision."

NCH_economic_revival:0 "Economic Boom"
NCH_economic_revival_desc:0 "During the crisis, the kingdom mobilized its economy and received an influx of investment from the river nations. This led to rapid production growth and a surge in trade. Our economy is overheated, but we have a chance to use resources wisely and seize the moment to bring Greneclyf to true prosperity."

NCH_businesses_do_not_stand_idle:0 "Buy Back Saor"
NCH_businesses_do_not_stand_idle_desc:0 "The Saor Special Economic Zone has fulfilled its purpose and must return to its native harbor. This will not be cheap, but Uliss is our city, not the property of the United River Company. It is time to finalize the deal."

NCH_bee_productivity:0 "Project ‘Apis’"
NCH_bee_productivity_desc:0 "‘Apis’ is a unique experimental supplement for changelings created by the scientist Franser Celarl. This innovation increases productivity and concentration. At the next session of the Eryahtas, Franser will present his project."

NCH_brood_of_working_drones:0 "Plan ‘Formicidae.’ "
NCH_brood_of_working_drones_desc:0 "Greneclyf is not infinite, and even after developing Aisling or the Grove, the population will continue to grow. Xylopa Valha has presented the so-called ‘Formicidae’ plan — an ambitious architectural project of underground civilian construction. It not only solves spatial problems but is also strategically important, as underground cities can withstand any bombardment, should war ever come to our home."

NCH_ensure_full_employment:0 "The Invisible Hoof of the Market"
NCH_ensure_full_employment_desc:0 "No one in our government trusts the concept of the free market, especially after the actions of the URC. Therefore, the Royal Enya Institute has proposed two concepts for the future economic doctrine of the state: ‘Eastern Phoenix’ and ‘Harmonic Solidarism’."

NCH_gaining_economic_power:0 "Support the Middle Class"
NCH_gaining_economic_power_desc:0 "The middle class is the backbone of any civilized nation. The larger it is, the more stable society becomes. The government must ensure that the majority of citizens belong to this group and have the opportunity not merely to survive, but to live."

NCH_mobilizing_the_economy:0 "Eastern Phoenix"
NCH_mobilizing_the_economy_desc:0 "‘Eastern Phoenix’ is a concept of centralized market statism, where the economy is built on exports, industrialization, and strict state control over strategic sectors. The state actively intervenes in the market, creating conditions for production growth and entrepreneurship. Through the private sector, the government directs the economy, strengthening domestic production and its position on foreign markets."

NCH_economics_of_friendship:0 "Harmonic Solidarism"
NCH_economics_of_friendship_desc:0 "‘Harmonic Solidarism’ is an economic system based on cooperation and the common good, inspired by the principles of harmony and the canons of the Church of Matrona. Its essence lies in cooperative ownership and cross-class social partnership. Planning plays a key role, forming the basis for organizing production and resource distribution, ensuring balance and stability in an economy oriented toward the common good"

# Gytha diplomatic patch #
NCH_we_are_not_alone:0 "We Are Not Alone"
NCH_we_are_not_alone_desc:0 "The events of the crisis have clearly shown that blissful isolation is a thing of the past. The time has come to introduce Greneclyf to the world, keeping both pen and sword at the ready."

NCH_new_opportunities:0 "A Gaze to the East"
NCH_new_opportunities_desc:0 "To the east we see a continent torn apart by wars and conflicts, ruled by violence and tears for bygone days. Yet there we also see a glimmer of hope — the River Coalition. It is clear that our fate will be intertwined with the river ponies. The only question is how close these bonds will become."

NCH_our_mission:0 "A Gaze to the West"
NCH_our_mission_desc:0 "Beyond impassable glaciers and straits lies our home — Equus. For nearly a thousand years, not a single hoof of the Lemann and Oir changeling lineages has stepped upon its soil, yet we know for certain that Equestria still exists. We must meet them to understand the state of our ancestral lands. Surely, the ponies will be glad to see changelings...  won’t they?"

NCH_neighborhood:0 "Good Neighborhood"
NCH_neighborhood_desc:0 "During the crisis, we learned that besides the tribes of Farbrook, two more pony communities inhabit the hills — Rijekograd and the Fir Villages. We should turn our attention to them, secure our influence, and...  civilize them."

NCH_another_visit:0 "A Loyal Friend in the Hills"
NCH_another_visit_desc:0 "Among the hills there is one community that caught the queen’s particular interest — Rijekograd. Sacred springs, mineral-rich waters, and an unusually peaceful coexistence make this quasi-state the most stable in the region. That is precisely why securing the support of the Guardian Iselin is so important."

NCH_pacts_exchange_for_support:0 "Extending a Hand of Friendship"
NCH_pacts_exchange_for_support_desc:0 "We will formally offer the hill ponies assistance in industrialization and education in exchange for love and support for Greneclyf, both now and in the future, thus renewing the Great Agreements. Let us see whether they accept."

NCH_long_cooperation:0 "Reaping the Rewards"
NCH_long_cooperation_desc:0 "Having finally secured a foothold in the region, we must develop a plan for the further integration of the hills into the kingdom. The queen would clearly not be pleased if they were to reject our friendship, so they should be gently encouraged to accept it."

NCH_not_so_different:0 "Not So Different After All"
NCH_not_so_different_desc:0 "It all worked out, and the hill ponies are ready to accept us. This joyful event proves that our values are shared, and in its honor we will begin building a unified community as soon as possible, demonstrating to the entire world an example of harmony."

NCH_bring_them_harmony:0 "Yet We Are Different"
NCH_bring_them_harmony_desc:0 "Necromancers, warlords, savages, pagans...  the hills turned out to be far more dangerous and unpredictable than we expected. As a result, Semper Fay has issued a decree on the forced deportation of extremist elements to the uninhabited lands of the far north. One way or another, harmony will return to these lands."

NCH_new_great_agreement:0 "Continental Prefectures"
NCH_new_great_agreement_desc:0 "The navy under the command of Semper Fay achieved a triumphant victory, nearly tripling the territory of our kingdom. Now we must immediately organize the integration of the new prefectures and begin colonizing sparsely populated regions, showing the utmost respect for local communities."


# LEFT #
NCH_river_pf_opportunity:0 "A River of Opportunities"
NCH_river_pf_opportunity_desc:0 "The river governments are guided by the noblest of ideas — the idea of unity. We know that the ponies of the east dream of a federal project, yet not all of them agree on its form, and even among the supporters there are opportunists and villains who wish to unite nations through violence for their own plutocratic interests. We will not allow them to kill this idea — or drown it in the blood of the innocent."

NCH_peaceful_coexistence:0 "Peaceful Coexistence"
NCH_peaceful_coexistence_desc:0 "We are driven by love, just like any truly rational beings of this world. Wise creatures once gave this principle a beautiful name — ‘pacifism’. This is precisely the policy we intend to pursue with the Coalition. After all, is not a peaceful sky the dream of every generation?"

NCH_trade_development:0 "Trade Development"
NCH_trade_development_desc:0 "The United River Company is not the same as the national economies of the river ponies. Despite the difficult past associated with Saor, today we are ready for an equal dialogue — one that will bring great benefits both to them and to us."

NCH_open_up_the_shopping_districts:0 "The Golden Crescent"
NCH_open_up_the_shopping_districts_desc:0 "One way to demonstrate our friendship is to propose a joint naval operation to the coastal states — an operation that will permanently secure the region’s sea lanes from monsters, pirates, and the sorcerers of Magehold. Due to glacial barriers in the west, the route will circle the continent, becoming a safe alternative passage for traders from Zebrica and Griffonia."

NCH_scout_the_situation:0 "Assess the Situation"
NCH_scout_the_situation_desc:0 "There is troubling news: we have learned that not all ponies within the Coalition are sympathetic toward changelings. Some are openly hostile, having remained trapped in their archaic xenophobic views."

NCH_visit_to_riverlands:0 "Embassy in Dal Mor"
NCH_visit_to_riverlands_desc:0 "We are officially opening an embassy in the capital of Ponyayani— Dal Mor. This choice is no coincidence. Ponyayanian Takh-Fada is a unique example of peaceful harmony and coexistence within the Coalition. Of course, establishing embassies in a tribal confederation is no easy task, but we have compelling strategic reasons."

NCH_cit_thrpugh_the_bureaurcracy:0 "Cut Through the Bureaucracy"
NCH_cit_thrpugh_the_bureaurcracy_desc:0 "Amendment A39 of the Coltstream Treaty outlines the following requirements for a state seeking to sign it: sharing borders with the alliance and possessing a legitimate, non-tyrannical regime. Additional conditions include guarantees from treaty members, membership in the Coalition, or being a military ally fighting on the same side."

NCH_embed_agents_in_goverments:0 "Operation ‘Patriots’"
NCH_embed_agents_in_goverments_desc:0 "Some are deeply displeased with our attempts to establish contact with the river ponies. Certain politicians are turning the populace against us, and in places our citizens are even being assaulted — as in Bakara. It is time for some individuals to reconsider their views."

NCH_not_so_united:0 "Not So United"
NCH_not_so_united_desc:0 "Well, it was obvious — despite its outward unity, the River Coalition is internally diseased. Some of its parts are afflicted by delusions of superiority and communism, and when one organ fails, the entire organism begins to falter."

NCH_finding_allies_in_coalition:0 "Three in a Perfect Pair"
NCH_finding_allies_in_coalition_desc:0 "On the path toward unification with the river ponies, we must secure reliable support from members of the alliance. Gytha places a rather unexpected bet on what appears to be an outsider state... "

# RIGHT #
NCH_their_light_beckons_us:0 "Trouble on the Home Front"
NCH_their_light_beckons_us_desc:0 "Equus. Home. At least it was, centuries ago, before the houses of Ditrysium drove us into exile. It is time to visit our native lands after so many years... "

NCH_emvassy_to_equestria:0 "The Homeland"

NCH_equestria_support_desc:0 "In exchange for our political support and the adoption of certain harmonic concepts, we request a reciprocal gesture — military protection. Naturally, this is largely a formal step, as no one currently threatens us and Equestria is preoccupied with Chrysalis, but it will open new avenues for future cooperation and actions on Equus itself."

Naturally, we would be flattered if Greneclyfian became that language, but linguists from several countries proposed an alternative — ‘Inter-river’.

NCH_discipline_is_key_to_order:0 "Political Commissars"
NCH_discipline_is_key_to_order_desc:0 "Latro’s criticism was not unfounded: without strict oversight, a regular army risks devolving into a horde of killers. To address this, Carrion introduces the institution of commissars—ideological zealots whose primary mission is discipline.

There is no need for them to die in senseless assaults if the enemy can be destroyed from afar. Project “Basilisk” focuses on a dramatic increase in the combat effectiveness of our artillery, even at the cost of higher production expenses. The use of obsidian alloys for military purposes will make our guns truly lethal, capable of piercing any defense."

NCH_goddes_of_war:0 "Project “Hydra”"

greneclyf_base.1.t:0 "Legacy"
greneclyf_base.1.d:0 "Gytha slowly sifted through last year’s reports and old newspapers, trying to form the most accurate picture possible of the country that had fallen into her hooves. \n\n ‘Luddites, luddites, luddites... there weren’t this many of them when I was younger, was there?’, the queen glanced wistfully out the window, frowning at the gathering clouds. \n\n ‘I suppose that is the price of progress. What was the earliest record of machine dissent? The 90s? Holy Matron, I was barely a hatchling back then! Enya managed to so radically reshape society In just a single generation...’ , Gytha studied the raindrops forming on the glass, reflecting on how the old country of collective labor had so swiftly turned into a divided society of guilds, manufactories, elites, and the poor. \n\n ‘Your Majesty?’, Lord Protector of the realm Basalt Shaw entered the study, awkwardly tapping a hoof against the open door.’ Is something troubling you?’\n\n ‘It appears industrialization was much costlier than I could have imagined. To think, the machinery from Griffonia would strip away so many jobs! And the luddites...’ \n\n ‘At your word, the guard will deal with them, Lady Gytha.’ \n\n ‘No. Under no circumstances. They are my little subjects — innocent and hungry workers who were robbed of their means to find purpose. No force must ever be used against the suffering. We took their work from them — the solution must be ours to find. I...  I will come up with something at the gathering of the Eryahtas. This is our first and most pressing issue,’ Gytha declared resolutely, her eyes darting across lines describing how unemployment had enriched new industrialists while impoverishing ordinary drones.’ By the way, why did you come? Some matter of business?’\n\n Shaw nodded with a neutral expression.’ The Royal Guard. As the new Commander-in-Chief, I have several concepts for modernizing our army, but since you mentioned the Eryahtas, that is where it shall be decided. I will trouble you no further,’ the Lord Protector turned to leave, but paused as if recalling something.’ Her Excellency, Supreme Judge Oiren, asked me to convey that she would like to meet you in the library this evening. What should I tell her?’\n\n Gytha was still processing the thought that she would soon be involved in military modernization, when a familiar name pulled her from her trance.’ Oiren?’, the queen’s face softened slightly."

greneclyf_base.1.a:0 "‘I will be there. Tell her to bring that Hindian tea again.’ "


greneclyf_base.2.t:0 "The Gathering of the Eryahtas"
greneclyf_base.2.d:0 "Both chambers of the representative parliament gathered within the ancient halls of Blosmport Abbey, just as they and their predecessors had done for over eight hundred years. Yet today’s session was unusual: every prefect, cardinal, officer, and bureaucrat present sensed the weight of unprecedented change. The shouts and aggressive disputes typical of the Abbey during sessions gave way to excited whispers, abruptly silenced by the sharp strike of Supreme Judge Oiren of Oir’s gavel. \n\n ‘Order!’, she took a deep breath and continued in her commanding tone.’ The First Gathering of the Eryahtas under the blessed reign of Her Majesty Gytha of Lemann is hereby declared open! The floor is granted to the monarch herself.’ \n\n Oiren fixed her expectant and stern gaze upon Gytha, and only the queen could perceive, within that expression, the gentleness and encouragement of a sworn sister urging her to begin. \n\n ‘I...  ahem, am honored to greet the representatives of our proud communities under one roof for the first time. We are at the dawn of history’s making, for which the Glorious Enya sowed seeds throughout her life with the sweat and blood of our nation. The time has come to reap the fruits of her efforts and multiply them, without dishonoring the legacy of the previous queen — and for that, I and all of us will give our utmost,’ Gytha continued, her voice growing more emotional.’ Much work lies ahead: bringing the Guard to a state worthy of the 11th century, providing work to our people whose livelihoods were taken by machines, poverty returning to our streets for the first time since the First Great Famine,’ — she pressed on — ‘even the Abbey itself! The pretors tear at one another over interpretations of Matron’s word; how did we come to this?!’\n\n The queen met Oiren’s gaze once more, who subtly signaled the need to shift the direction of the speech. \n\n ‘But...  but there are also things that have worked flawlessly since Enya’s time — like Skyfall clocks. Our new legal system, whose Charter was written at the start of this century, and the introduction of the prefecture system, which has proven vastly more effective than the old feudal holdings. Today, as I expect, Prefect Carrion of our glorious capital will share his experience with the Eryahtas, after which other opinions and questions will be heard, so that together we may decide which path our country must walk. I thank you all sincerely.’ \n\n The assembled representatives greeted the queen with applause as she returned to her seat beside Oiren. \n\n ‘You did well,’ the Supreme Judge whispered with a barely noticeable smile, before resuming her authoritative tone as tradition demanded.’ Order! The floor is granted to Apex Carrion, Prefect of Blosmport.’ \n\n A tall, imposing changeling of noble bearing adjusted his monocle as he stepped to the podium and answered in a loud, gravelly voice:"

# Gytha Jorney #
greneclyf_base.3.t:0 "The Beginning of the Journey"
greneclyf_base.3.d:0 "Prefect Carrion had assembled a chunk of the city’s guard specifically for this day to hold a parade, wishing to show Gytha the state of affairs in Blosmport. The general was visibly proud of himself, craning his neck and baring a grin at the marching guards. \n\n Today, Gytha was not merely inspecting the city, but officially announcing the beginning of a royal tour across the entire island — an occasion the prefect chose to celebrate with a citywide festival. Subjects of the Crown wandered in family groups from one street vendor to another, while the crowd watched the officers with delight and enjoyed live music. \n\n ‘What do you think of the parade, Your Majesty?’, Carrion asked Gytha as she waved a hoof to the crowd. \n\n ‘I must admit,’ she began, ‘the way Blosmport has transformed since my childhood is astonishing. When I was a foal, our pier held only wooden boats — and looked at it now. It is an entire shipyard, where our first ship already awaits me!’\n\n Carrion adjusted his monocle, approvingly eyeing the steel leviathan.’ Yes, Her Majesty Enya truly was great, if she could introduce our people to such marvels. However, I must warn you, my Queen — other parts of our nation are...  not so advanced. You may even be shocked by how starkly the capital differs from the rest of the country,’ Carrion said, furrowing his brow. \n\n Gytha shrugged.’ Then that is precisely what I shall see, Prefect. In the end, it is I who must raise our country to an entirely new level, not someone else. And I am ready for it.’ \n\n The prefect allowed himself a faint smile, clearly admiring the queen’s resolve. She might be naïve, but there was undeniable potential in her for great deeds — given a more pragmatic approach."

greneclyf_base.3.a:0 "‘I wish you luck on your journey, Your Majesty.’ "

greneclyf_base.4.t:0 "Beyond the Golden Cage"
greneclyf_base.4.d:0 "Setting hoof on Aisling for the first time, Gytha gasped in surprise as she descended the gangway from the ship.  This was the state of her nation beyond the outskirts of the major cities? \n\n Her spiraling thoughts were soon interrupted by a modest welcoming ceremony, the sight was heartwarming as she saw her soot-stained subjects joyfully greeting their queen. At the center stood a tall changeling with a stern expression that softened into a weary smile upon seeing the two most important figures in the kingdom. \n\n ‘Your Majesty, Your Excellency — may the wisdom of the Matron illuminate your paths,’ the changeling bowed deeply. \n\n ‘It is good to see you, Pretor Onychion. Or do you prefer being addressed by your secular title of prefect?’, Oiren asked. \n\n Gytha studied him closely.’ Onychion..? You have aged so much since we last met! It is hard to believe you are the same changeling who conducted our initiation rite years ago.’ \n\n ‘Time flows, my Queen. The capital’s pretor and most likely future cardinal is now Actino. As for me, I have found my strength in service here — where I am needed by our brothers and sisters in faith as a prefect, not only as a spiritual guide,’ Onychion said, turning his gaze toward the people of Aisling. \n\n Over the following days, Gytha and Oiren studied local life firsthand. Daily conversations with Onychion revealed just how unevenly modernization had spread across the island: some changelings here could not even read, and a competent bureaucratic administration had only begun to rise under Enya, after a priest was appointed prefect. \n\n Bidding farewell to Aisling, the queen and her retinue departed for their next destination."

greneclyf_base.4.a:0 "Zhukomyr awaits!"

greneclyf_base.5.t:0 "The City of Steel"
greneclyf_base.5.d:0 "When Gytha arrived in Zhukomyr, the sight before her was wholly unexpected. In the middle of the square, a crowd surrounded a stout changeling who, sweating, pleaded for calm. Upon spotting the queen, her eyes widened and she spoke into the microphone once more.’ Your Majesty! Zhukomyr welcomes you!’\n\n The crowd froze, turning as one to face Gytha. She smiled awkwardly and waved to her subjects — and moments later they overwhelmed her with endless complaints.’ Queen, they took our jobs!’, ‘We have nothing left to eat, Your Majesty!’, ‘Matron, have mercy on us!’\n\n Oiren stepped forward before the stunned Gytha and shouted, ‘ORDER!’, silencing the crowd.’ I see now difficult times have befallen my homeland. Rejoice — not only has Her Majesty arrived for an inspection but so has your Supreme Judge. I will gladly hear your grievances to determine our course of action. And our esteemed Prefect Berylla will assist me in this, will she not?’, Oiren bared her fangs at the nervously swallowing official in the center of the square. \n\n Over the next several days, the queen and the Supreme Judge inspected manufactories and mines, repeatedly hearing accounts of labor conditions from factory workers, owners, the prefect, miners, and even the luddites — with whose leader Gytha shared tea under the watchful eye of her loyal Lord Protector, Shaw. \n\n Though Oiren did not show it outwardly, her heart ached at the sight of what the ancestral home of House Oir had become. Basalt sensed her sorrow and took upon himself part of the duties and conversations with citizens, sparing the judge from despair. \n\n One evening, the Supreme Judge visited her family nest. The same respectfully bowing gatekeeper, the same richly decorated walls, and the same sense of order amid chaos. \n\n ‘Oyri, is that you?’, asked an elderly noblemare seated by the fireplace. Her eyes opened, revealing the familiar cloudy haze. \n\n ‘Yes, mother...  it has been a long time,’ Oiren approached her ancestress, sat beside her, and allowed her to embrace her daughter. After several moments of silence, Oiren spoke again.’ How fares our house, mother?’\n\n The old noblemare frowned slightly, as if recalling recent events. \n\n ‘Foolish as ever. The elders care only for money and pleasure, the younger ones refuse to come to their senses. Though your nephew Kyanite is pushing his way into the prefecture, taking part in city affairs,’ the judge’s mother took a sip of a pungent herbal tincture before continuing.’ You two are the hope for true change within the house, Oiren. Your grandmother’s rule tipped the scales, and now we are either corrupted — like Isoviy, no doubt spoiling city mares again...’  she turned her blind gaze toward her daughter, ‘or the noble hope of our great family — like you and Kyanite. How tragic that the queen is Gytha, and not you, my dear,’ the ancestress smiled, a tear tracing its way down her face. \n\n The following morning, as the nervously chattering Berylla and representatives of every social estate saw the leaders of the state off, hope was kindled in each of their hearts — hope for the changes embodied by a new generation of power. Changes that would rein in Enya’s reforms and guide the country onto the proper path."

greneclyf_base.5.a:0 "The rumble of the train faded into the distance..."

greneclyf_base.6.t:0 "The Road Home"
greneclyf_base.6.d:0 "‘I am still surprised that for security you took only Basalt and a couple of guards, Gytha,’ Oiren snorted, gazing through the locomotive window at the forests of Greneclyf.’ As you can see, the lives of ordinary drones are far from ideal, and it would take only one enraged fanatic to plunge this country into a crisis beyond anything it has ever imagined.’ \n\n Gytha merely smiled in response, reading one of the reports from Aisling.’ Oiren, I appreciate your concern, but I am certain my subjects would never try to kill me. I am not afraid of them — I love each and every one of them, and I want them to see that. Besides, even if some...  peculiar element does appear among them, our tireless Lord Protector will deal with it in an instant!’\n\n A shadow of uncertainty crossed Oiren’s face as she considered her reply. In the end, she simply exhaled loudly.’ Gytha...  Do you remember the drones in Aisling? While you were speaking with Onychion about their lives, I spoke with the youth — illiteracy is universal. The education system can no longer cope; there are simply too many of us.’ \n\n ‘Add it to the list of problems we must solve,’ Gytha replied with a bitter smile.’ Or recall what Zhukomyr looks like now...  It pains me to see what it has become. Imagine it — once the first city of our people, now a dusty concrete sack.’ \n\n Oiren turned away, openly revealing sorrow for the state of her native hive for the first time. Yet moments later she concealed those feelings and looked at the queen with a smile.’ And what of Llir? What caused all that shouting in the office — did my Gytha scold someone over the poor harvest?’, the judge asked with a smirk. \n\n Gytha hesitated.’ Vixit is...  old-fashioned, though it is difficult to say that about someone who fills her home with so many machines. She knows what she is doing, she is wise — but she must adapt to the fact that we live in a new era. As for the harvest issues...’  the queen sighed, ‘I have some rather radical ideas related to...  Well, we will speak of it later. The peasants have also begun a witch hunt.’  Oiren looked at the queen inquisitively but said nothing. \n\n Gytha took a deep sip of tea, watching as darkness slowly swallowed the island landscapes beyond the window. \n\n ‘I am glad you are here with me, Oiren. It truly means a great deal to me,’ the queen said softly. \n\n ‘I know. We have been inseparable since childhood — even wearing a royal mantle will not free you from me, Leman,’ the judge chuckled. \n\n ‘Yes...’  Gytha murmured dreamily, settling more comfortably beside her and closing her eyes in exhaustion.’ May it always be so.’ \n\n Oiren wrapped a foreleg around her, then drifted into thoughts of how she would help the softly breathing queen beside her achieve, at any cost, a Greneclyf worth living in."

So the market does not regulate itself after all, and the republican economists of Kemera were mistaken — and sometimes state intervention is not such a terrible thing?\n\n ‘This Beakolini is certainly eccentric, but there is something to his ideas,’ Gytha drawled, examining the spider brought from Deponia, sealed within glass."

greneclyf_base.8.d:0 "When the time came to present her project, the blue-eyed changeling beamed widely and greeted the queen with a strong Aquellian accent:\n\n ‘Bonjour, Votre Majesté! I am absolutely delighted to present to you a miniature model of housing that will one day stand in every corner of our glorious homeland — cheap, practical, and adorable, oui!’, the young architect chirped, nearly bouncing in place. \n\n ‘Miss Xylocopa Valga, to the point,’ Oiren spoke skeptically. \n\n ‘Oui, oui! Please!’, Valga replied, magically lifting a velvet cloth to reveal a small building model. Gytha stepped closer, examining it carefully. \n\n ‘This is...  what exactly, dear Valga?’\n\n ‘This, Your Majesty, is what in Aquellia is called “construction modulaire”. The idea is that such a building is not constructed on site but assembled from panel blocks manufactured in factories in advance! The savings are incredible — and look!’, Xylocopa stepped closer, eyes blazing with excitement as she removed the model’s top to reveal the interior. \n\n ‘Here, here, ma Reine, do you see? The space is fully optimized so that future residents can comfortably perform all household tasks. Do you realize how many kilometers an average homemaker walks while cooking stew and caring for offspring? Of course, it is exhausting — but not in a home like this, where everything is close at hoof,’ she said, laying out a blueprint showing the dimensions of a standard apartment. \n\n ‘The space seems rather small. I would even say, bordering on uncomfortable,’ the Supreme Judge remarked.’ Are you certain this is not excessive?’\n\n ‘Non, non, non, not at all! Everything is precisely calculated. I did not merely defend my thesis on this subject — I lived in such a building myself. This is called rational efficiency, exactly what our island needs in such difficult times,’ Xylocopa replied with another dazzling smile. \n\n After a brief discussion and a nod from Oiren, Gytha responded:"

greneclyf_base.8.a:0 "‘Miss Valga, congratulations. Your project is approved.’ "

greneclyf_base.9.t:0 "A Letter from the Baroness"
greneclyf_base.9.d:0 "Sweating slightly, Gytha read the beautifully penned letter, marked with a vulgar lipstick mark upon the paper — clearly revealing its author. \n\n ‘Esteemed Queen and dear niece, \n\n To my great misfortune, the harvest problems began even earlier than I had anticipated. An unexpected northern storm destroyed the meager crops we already had. The Sacred Grove is forced to introduce a rationing system for food, and by my decree as prefect I am imposing a curfew upon the streets to prevent unrest at its root. I earnestly ask you to take action and remain ever ready to aid. \n\n Yours always, \n\n Baroness Vixit Lemann, Prefect of Llir’"

greneclyf_base.9.a:0 "‘Damn it...’ "

greneclyf_base.10.t:0 "Reality Hit"
greneclyf_base.10.d:0 "‘Sorry, could you repeat that?’, Gytha asked her Lord Protector, twitching an eye. \n\n ‘Famine, Your Majesty. Farbrook has had a failed fishing season. We hoped to buy what we lack from Bakara, but the River Coalition tariffs are beyond what our treasury can bear. I fear the country stands on the brink of what happened eight hundred years ago...’ \n\n Gytha slammed her hooves onto the desk, snorting with anger.’ We still have time! We still have room to maneuver! Shaw, meet the Eryahtas at once! Summon Oiren!’\n\n Basalt nodded, grasping the gravity of the situation, bowed, and hurried away to contact the state’s leading figures. \n\n Gytha collapsed into her chair, staring at her trembling hooves. She knows what hunger is; the entire island learned the lesson of the First Great Famine eight centuries ago, ensuring that descendants would never forget the horrific images of emaciated drones devouring one another with revulsion on their faces.

Anything was better than cannibalism, ruin, or revolution. \n\n Still, when she entered the hall in her strict service jacket, escorting Gytha and Shaw, irritation did not leave her stony face as she caught the wide-eyed stares of several ponies. Throughout the evening’s conversations, it was painfully clear that these arrogant riverlanders considered her bloodline savages — crude fools to be deceived and led by the nose. \n\n And being dependent on them was humiliating. \n\n When the dinner ended and Gytha, exhausted by endless attempts to placate those snobs, dragged herself to her room, Oiren once again heard her muffled sobs through the night. \n\n And then and there she swore to do everything in her power to hold back the vultures from the continent."

greneclyf_base.16.d:0 "After signing countless lengthy contracts and agreements, Gytha paused at the last one, staring at the riverlandian representative with a look of great annoyance and fatigue. \n\n ‘A gambling zone? What does that even mean?’, the queen threw a questioning glance at the fidgeting Bakaran pony. \n\n ‘You see, Your Majesty,’ the pony coughed and began cautiously, ‘in many riverland countries casinos are either banned or left uncontrolled, turning into breeding grounds for delinquents. And so...  My patrons propose that you open the first legal casino in Saor, where ponies from across the Riverlands can go to spend their bits.’ \n\n Onychion, present at the meeting as Prefect of Aisling, sprang up in fury. \n\n ‘You want to open the doors to lust and sin in our holy nation?!’, he roared, glaring at the trade representative, who shrank deeper into her chair. \n\n ‘Your Majesty, even as a representative of the schismatics, I cannot approve this in any way. It is vile!’\n\n ‘And you think I don’t know that?!’, Gytha herself snapped, slamming a hoof on the table.’ Spare me your sermons about Matrona, Onychion — our people are starving! What are they supposed to feed on?! Your speeches?!  They’re going to resort to cannibalism!’, she added sharply, sinking back into her chair. \n\n ‘I-if you permit...’ , the representative raised a trembling hoof, feigning a tight smile.’ From the fees alone your treasury will receive a great deal of money. I guarantee demand for such a business is enormous! A-and it will also improve the investment appeal for tourism!’\n\n Onychion looked like a scolded child and exhaled heavily. With a swift stroke of her pen, Gytha authorized the venture, then lifted her gaze sharply toward the pony. \n\n ‘What is your name?’\n\n ‘S-Sweet Sprinkle,’ she stammered, adjusting her glasses. \n\n ‘From now on, Miss Sprinkle, you will be held accountable for everything that happens in Saor. Understood? You are dismissed.’ \n\n The queen turned away, clearly unwilling to continue the conversation. \n\n The Bakaran’s eyes widened.

He finished his cider, removed his cap, and nodded amicably. \n\n ‘Lord Protector! It is a great honor to meet you. How can I help?’\n\n Basalt gave him a skeptical once-over but got to the point all the same:\n\n ‘Greetings, Captain Butler. I am here on behalf of Her Excellency the Supreme Judge. She wishes to know why the URC sent its own police regiment here instead of relying on the Guard.’ \n\n The captain’s smile dimmed slightly. \n\n ‘To be honest, my lord, they simply don’t trust you,’ he said, looking at the changeling.’ The formal reason is ‘ensuring the safety of all international guests’ and other vague wording. But in practice it’s about trust. Or rather — the lack of it, he-he-he.’ \n\n ‘You are...  remarkably candid, Captain. While that deserves respect, the situation itself is dispiriting.’ \n\n The pony nodded with understanding, lazily eyeing the rumps of passing mares, then looked back at Lord Shaw. \n\n ‘Your Lordship, I’ll be frank: I don’t give a damn about politics. In my life I have three passions — drink, mares, and martial valor. I can find all three here with ease. And I offer you, as a representative of the last, my friendship. I respect you as an officer respects a commander, and I guarantee I will quietly keep you informed about what’s happening in Saor — behind the General Staff’s back. Provided, of course, you don’t meddle in the zone’s affairs directly, so as not to scare off the merchants, he-he-he. Agreed?’\n\n The pony grinned again, but in that grin Shaw saw no threat. Before him sat more of a mischievous colt, eager to cause a little trouble for his superiors for reasons unknown to Basalt. \n\n Basalt exhaled. \n\n ‘Very well. If the only alternative is storming this so-called zone with the Guard and severing ties with the Coalition, I have no choice. But I expect absolute honesty, Captain.’ "

She looked up from it again, standing before a manifestation of a miracle. \n\n ‘Dear Baroness,\n\n We love Llir and wish to help you and all its inhabitants.

And the question is acute: to whom should it be distributed? Anticipating your question, Your Majesty, I will say at once — Berilla and I have calculated everything. Equal distribution is impossible, and it will satisfy no one. Therefore,’ the Zhukomir prefect’s protégé switched the slide, ‘we have identified three target consumer groups. Group A — officials and administration; Group B — the workforce; Group C — the lumpen.’ \n\n ‘One might say that in the name of harmony everything should go to Group C. But, Your Majesty, what is the point of that?’, Kyanite added, not hiding his skepticism. \n\n Gytha glanced at him, scarcely believing her ears.’ The point is that otherwise they will simply die, Kyanite.’ \n\n ‘And so what?’, the deputy prefect blurted out shamelessly. \n\n The Queen felt a surge of anger and was about to rise, but Berilla stopped her.’ Y-Your Majesty, allow me to explain this a little differently. Forgive my protégé’s bluntness.’ \n\n The official stood, stepping toward the charts and gently moving Kyanite aside.’ The problem is that allocating the surplus to Group A will improve the efficiency of the administrative apparatus and speed our way out of the crisis. Allocating rations to Group B — our workers — will allow them to produce more, buying us time and yielding more food in the future. As for allocating to Group C...’ , the Prefect hesitated slightly.’ The only reason to increase rations for the poor is to prevent an uprising. It is a way to pacify the masses, but at the cost of workers and ourselves going hungry. Of course, there is a certain logic to this, but...’ \n\n ‘But strategically it is far more advantageous to increase rations for workers and suppress poverty with force!’, Kyanite interjected, not letting Berilla finish.’ Your Majesty, one must be rational here. Please consider everything as carefully as possible. Feed the parasites — and you risk everything else; feed the soldiers — and they will leap into Tartarus for you, eliminating threats along the way.’ \n\n Gytha pondered this. Her gaze was icy, yet she could not deny the rationality of the proposal. After long deliberation, she said:"

Or the second, which I propose to you as a Greneclyfer. Leave them a message. I will handle it personally, if that is your order, Lady Oiren. Retribution will be guaranteed.’ \n\n The Supreme Judge reflected. On the one hoof, one could proceed according to the law — albeit one imposed from outside — so that everything ran smoothly. On the other, humiliation could not be endured, and anyone who sinned against the subjects she had sworn to protect had to know that retribution was inevitable. \n\n At last, she decided:"

Please accompany us to the station while the circumstances are clarified.’ \n\n The unicorn looked the captain up and down with contempt and snorted:\n\n ‘First, I have diplomatic immunity.

He leaned toward the suspect’s ear and hissed:\n\n ‘Your choices are limited, Wittenland rat: either you come with me, or—doing a favor to a veeeery angry royal regime—I shoot you during the arrest. This is not the slave magocracy of your native dump. Don’t get cocky, hee-hee-hee...’ \n\n The chuckle sounded especially vile to the ambassador.

Spark himself is on the upper deck, at least four armed subjects there as well, the remaining twelve scattered below.

They found Spark last—his face frozen in a foolish expression, a bullet hole gaping in his skull. \n\n In light of the news, the ORC declared the sea region dangerous, reducing the flow of clients.

The mere memory of his look and her aunt’s ringing laughter made Gytha’s cheeks flush, and she stepped into the train vestibule to clear her head. \n\n Basalt Shaw was there as well, reading an encrypted report on regional security status, and without looking up said: ‘Nervous, my lady?’\n\n Gytha sighed and admitted: ‘I’m already a monarch, yet I still fear Vixit’s laughter. And did Enya really have to appoint her prefect?’\n\n Shaw replied thoughtfully: ‘If I recall correctly, this branch of House Lemann has held these lands almost since Ulysses’ expedition a century ago. It’s hardly surprising a relative of yours was chosen as prefect.’ \n\n ‘Yes, yes...  know-it-all,’ the queen pouted. \n\n Upon arrival, the state’s first figures were escorted by richly dressed guards past vast fields worked by peasants to a large white manor. From the outside it looked like a feudal estate with slaves, but in truth the city—the kingdom’s agrarian hub—lay slightly below. The manor served as both administration and residence of its prefect—Baroness Vixit of House Lemann, famed for her eccentricity and love of inventions. Inside, Gytha asked her retinue to wait and went alone to speak with the baroness through strange mechanical doors. \n\n ‘It’s been far too long since I last saw your charming little face, dear,’ purred a thin changeling with long black hair uncharacteristic of House Lemann, her face hidden behind a red, embroidered Kirian fan.’ What brings you here?’\n\n Gytha gave a nervous smile: ‘An inspection of the kingdom ahead of reforms, aunt.

But why?’ Gytha asked. \n\n ‘The experiments of the agrarians who lived in Brodfeld,’ Vixit drawled.’ Failure after failure. Do not worry, my dear queen, I have already had them executed.’ \n\n ‘Wh—’ Gytha choked.’ I-is that not too radical, dear baroness?’\n\n ‘Not in the slightest. They placed us on the brink of famine that could cost thousands of lives through negligence. They were obliged to pay for it,’ the baroness’s face grew sterner.’ Mistakes of this magnitude must never be forgiven, my monarch. I ask you to remember this throughout your reign.’ \n\n A swarm of thoughts buzzed in Gytha’s head. On the one hoof, there was truth in Vixit’s words; on the other, execution for merely trying to help the country and failing?\n\n The prefect set down her fan and lit a thin cigarette through a long holder.’ Power is responsibility. And responsibility for a future tragedy lay with them. I will accept any punishment you deem fit for allowing this to happen, my queen.’ \n\n Gytha slammed her hooves on the table, shouting at her relative.’ Enough! We live in a new age without aristocratic arbitrariness. The Supreme Judge is sitting in your corridor right now, shaping a system of law under which all are equal. I do not want to hear of any self-rule or extrajudicial reprisals again, Vixit!’ she snapped, trembling slightly. \n\n Vixit said nothing, slowly drawing in the bluish smoke and placing another paper on the table—a drawn symbol.’ And this is the second piece of news,’ she said with closed eyes.’ The peasants claim a witches’ coven has settled in the Sacred Grove. These are likely wild rumors, but the guard found these symbols in several places across Llir. I will make efforts to identify them, though I suspect it is a waste of time. We simply need to calm the peasants that there is no blasphemy against Matrona in a holy place.’ \n\n The queen examined the curious symbol and tucked it among the other documents in her bag.

They sound incredibly Skynavian, I must note. Do you even understand a word of this?’\n\n ‘Queen, we love you!’ someone cried from the crowd, others joining in, but Gytha stopped them with a hoof gesture, continuing to look at the shouter. \n\n ‘Quiet, friends. Tell me instead, who put you up to this? The situation in the country is improving—you feel it yourselves. The entire Chancellery, the whole Eryahtas, is working at its limits, and you see the results. Yes, the process is not smooth. Yes, we had to adapt. But is this a reason to riot and cause trouble?’\n\n She turned to the crowd.’ So tell me, where did this idea of unrest come from?’\n\n Turning back to the shouter, she found only empty space where he had stood and allowed herself a faint smile. \n\n ‘Very well, my little subjects, return to your homes.

What’s so funny about it?’\n\n The Judge barely managed to get back up, catching her breath after the fit of laughter. \n\n ‘Gytha I love you, but that has to be the dumbest idea I’ve heard in a long time! Sit down, we need to talk.’ \n\n She sat back down, waiting for the queen to do the same. \n\n ‘Take a look at Sweet Sprinkle’s report. Even though she ended up here under rather...  unusual circumstances, the mare has become quite good at her job as administrator of the Zone.

Love can be harvested in many ways, and the love foolish visitors have for gambling is also love we can take for ourselves.’ \n\n ‘What are you getting at, dear?’\n\n ‘That we can stage a diversion by secretly placing disguised changelings among croupiers and casino staff. Basalt’s trained agents will be able to transform the addictions of gamblers, addicts, alcoholics, and other scum into a concentrate of love, which we will distribute to citizens. It is not much, and it is not the highest-quality love, but we must take it all—’\n\n ‘I fully agree, Oyri,’ a sudden voice interrupted. \n\n The black-haired prefect of Llir, Baroness Vixit herself, had appeared in the office. \n\n ‘And I will help with this by directing my inventors to fund this plan of yours. The right machines and extraction methods will give us both the love we need and valuable experience for future developments. What do you say, my queen?’ Gytha, still sitting in the utterly inappropriate wedding dress, thought for a moment, then nodded eagerly. ‘Yes! I see nothing wrong with this.

In matters like these there is always a “but”,’ the queen cut her off. \n\n ‘Very well, I will be frank, if you permit. Separate treaties with each country would drive the kingdom into a debt trap. Therefore, as your broker and administrator of Saor, I recommend signing a compromise agreement with the URC. URC shares are stable, and even if some countries leave the Coalition, the company itself will endure. This will allow you to stabilize the situation and avoid famine. \n\n Just...  Keep in mind that this is not aid, Your Majesty. This is business. Everything has its price. But it is better to pay less for something reliable than to squander funds aimlessly, is it not? Even your investment in hiring me proved sound: my appointment as chair of Saor may have shocked me, but for you it was a far more advantageous move than letting yet another URC corporatocrat take the seat. \n\n So...  Let us work together to solve your problems. You are not alone.’ \n\n Gytha nodded and signed the contract expanding the powers of the United River Company within her country.

Nests of conspiracy were uncovered throughout the capital region. The prefect was beside himself with fury that treacherous rats had been roaming and plotting right under his nose, yet they gave no chance for interrogation—anyone caught would immediately kill themselves, by poison or by gunshot. \n\n The case archives swelled: signs, pamphlets, records, confiscated weapons. A coup had been maturing in the country, spurred by communists intending to exploit the recent crisis as a pretext. Their so-called party was not even registered in the kingdom, let alone known to the citizens. \n\n Finally, when a liaison officer burst into yet another cleared room, he quickly spoke with Carrion—the secret service had deciphered fragments of one ‘revolutionary’s’ diary. They described an emergency plan of action in case the underground was exposed. \n\n The Praetorian Guard intercepted the agents in the port of Aisling. Shaw and Carrion watched through binoculars as a small vessel faced them, several changelings with their families staring back. The general raised a hoof to order an artillery strike, but the lord-protector stopped him. \n\n ‘They have learned their lesson, prefect. Send them to Tartarus. We have no need to become child-killers.’ \n\n ‘What about the data?’, Carrion asked, still observing through the binoculars what had once been the greatest threat to the kingdom. \n\n ‘We will study everything thoroughly and develop counter-strategies. We must understand the enemy and its goals. And understand them well.’ \n\n The soldiers and agents dispersed, and soon a detailed report on the “Crimson Sunset” case lay upon Gytha’s desk."

Moments as calm as this one would grow fewer, so there was no need to spoil it with talk. Still, Oiren could not help looking at Gytha. The wind gently stirred her rose-colored hair, and her gaze held firmness and certainty. She was no longer who she had been before the famine began; now, before the Judge stood a strong, mature monarch, ready to lead an entire nation. \n\n Suddenly, from the open door came the strikes of a great clock, announcing five in the morning.

This is the future, you understand? This is not just a gold mine—it’s a real way to shape public opinion!’ Gagat began to dissolve into blissful laughter, so hard that tears streamed from his eyes, yet he could not stop. \n\n ‘And I see you’re fired up about it.

Enclosed, I attach an official petition requesting that You allow me to personally lead the investigative measures aimed at uncovering sorcerous activity. \n\n Yours sincerely,\n\n Prefect of Llir, Baroness Vixit Lehmann’\n\n The queen quickly read the letter before glancing at the copies of the coven’s marks, then pointing her gaze towards the reports on the strange harvest and mysterious healings that had occurred during the crisis."

She had always felt a genuine pull toward anything that stirred her mind, and so the desire to prove or disprove the existence of witches in her lands became another captivating game of intellect for the baroness. \n\n After questioning subjects and guards, she assembled approximate information: the witches might number anywhere from four to six, and after each of their “operations” they leave a coven mark—just like the one Vixit had found in the letter during the investigation of the plot where witches’ seeds had sprouted. \n\n The inhabitants’ opinions were divided. Some were certain the witches did evil, others claim they did only good, and a third group denied their existence altogether, attributing everything to Matrona’s miracles. \n\n Smiling with satisfaction and leisurely exhaling a thread of bluish smoke through her holder, Vixit headed for the last place where witch activity had been seen—on the outskirts of the Holy Grove. \n\n ‘Decided to show up for once in a century?!’ a local priest, Xido, barked at her irritably. \n\n ‘Watch your tone, rabble. Do not forget who you are speaking to,’ the baroness tilted her head coldly.’ I have come by direct order of the queen to investigate the actions of the witches’ coven.’ \n\n The priest grimaced, but soon perked up.’ High time. There was an arson recently, part of the flock died—and the marks left behind! Those cursed marks are everywhere! Matrona is my witness, it is certainly the fault of those impious mares!’\n\n ‘Marks..? Tell me more about the fire.’ \n\n Xido sighed heavily.’ I...  I arrived only when it was already burning.

But Please, in the name of justice for your family, tell me what happened that night.’ \n\n The teenager looked at the baroness with frightened eyes, searching for words. She was silent for a long time before speaking: ‘I-it was at night, two days ago. I h-heard frightening voices behind the wall... laughter...  And then lightning struck our house! But not from the sky, I swear! It came from the side!’\n\n The drone sobbed, trying to hold back tears.’ Father went to see what was going on, but the cursed...’  Her voice broke, and she finally gave in to her emotions.’ The cursed witches... they burned him alive! And then they destroyed our home...  They left nothing but their marks...  everywhere...’ \n\n Vixit calmly exhaled a ring of smoke.’ Where was your house?’\n\n After the answer, she nodded and went to the place now called the Pyre. \n\n Wandering among the charred ruins, the baroness found mysterious signs left on the walls and floor. She studied them closely and frowned. These marks did not match those she had seen earlier in the letter. They were rougher and more ornate. \n\n She returned to the dignitary: ‘Where are the bodies?’\n\n ‘Being prepared for burial, in the—hey!’\n\n The priest did not have time to finish: Vixit shoved him aside and hurried into the church basement. \n\n In the darkness of the cold room, she found the family’s bodies covered with veils. One by one she uncovered them, carefully examining the charred remains of her former subjects. Xido prayed behind her, wailing about blasphemy. \n\n The baroness rose indifferently and threw out, ‘I am staying here for the night. Prepare a bed for me.’ "

Vixit surged after her at once, and the chase vanished into the forest’s darkness. \n\n She ran through thickets, branches cracking under hoof. Out of breath, the prefect finally stopped before an old manor. The house looked ancient, but it was clearly cared for. Warm light glowed in the windows. \n\n The baroness exhaled, steadied herself, and opened the door. \n\n And inside, she saw them. \n\n A zebra was brewing some sort of potion, sprinkling it with dried herbs with a coltish zeal, while a batpony—apparently the one Vixit had been chasing—rushed up to her, chattering rapidly. A unicorn and a doe broke off their tea, freezing and staring at the unexpected guest. And a pegasus with gleaming fangs kept writing something. \n\n ‘Oh...  is that you, baroness?’ the zebra spoke first. \n\n Then, giving the batpony a calming look, she added, ‘Do not worry, Nachtalina. That is our prefect.’ \n\n Vixit swept her gaze around the room. \n\n ‘You...’  she narrowed her eyes, ‘you are the “sisters”? The very witches?’\n\n The doe smiled:"

It was our Gismirra who drew it—she came up with the design of our sign herself,’ said the unicorn, stepping toward the satisfied pegasus. \n\n The baroness went on: ‘And one more thing. The farmer’s family’s bodies were cut up...  by something long and thin.’ \n\n ‘Long and thin?’ The pegasus turned to the doe.’ Valfrida, does that tell you anything?’ The doe shook her head. \n\n ‘Purvita?’ Gismirra turned to the unicorn. \n\n ‘I never took an interest in pagan rites, forgive me, dear,’ the unicorn replied, tossing her head. ‘Demonic marks!’ Nachtalina continued, speaking excitedly.’ It was them, Sanctella, I’m sure! The village is in danger!’ The zebra frowned, folding her forehooves across her chest.’ Runes...  a long implement for killing...’  she murmured.’ Feels like demon-worship. Someone was sacrificed.’ \n\n She snapped her head toward Vixit.’ Your Grace, please—let us postpone introductions. We must save the village immediately. I will help you!’\n\n ‘And...’  Purvita had begun, but the zebra raised a hoof, stopping her. \n\n ‘No, girls. Stay here. The baroness and I will handle this.’ \n\n The way back passed in tense silence between Vixit and Sanctella—until the sharp stink of smoke hit them. They quickened their pace, then broke into a run. The prefect readied her magic to strike, while the zebra feverishly leafed through a small book of spells and ancient script. \n\n A blood-red dawn greeted them as they neared the settlement: the scarlet sky of early morning blended with the thick, black reek of fires. \n\n They reached the church and threw open the heavy doors. Corpses with dreadful faces lay in the pool of their last communion. Dark streams spread like tongues across the floor, flooded the tiles, curled in thin rivulets along the steps—where, among the slain, lay hooks and hacksaws. \n\n Vixit felt nausea overtake her, her certainty slipping for a moment. Sanctella, however, surveyed the scene with a cold, hard stare. \n\n And then she rose. \n\n A thin, fragile little body shook in a fit of soundless laughter. An empty, crazed gaze fixed on the sorceress and the prefect. \n\n ‘Briona...’  Vixit breathed. ’I should have guessed.’ \n\n ‘No, Miss Vixit.’  The zebra’s voice was even, but heavy.’  This is not a child. This is a demon that seized her soul and devoured it. Unfortunately, there is no saving her.’ \n\n ‘Then we can lay her to rest!’ the baroness shouted, firing magic at the convulsing body. It sprang aside like a coil. The monster erupted into another fit of chilling laughter and, with a motion both elegant and grotesque, hurled a sheaf of daggers at the baroness—when Sanctella shoved her aside, saving her from death. \n\n The monster kept laughing and laughing. The baroness trembled for the first time, feeling fear. But the zebra continued reading aloud—her voice growing louder, her words gaining force—and in answer to them the creature began to writhe in convulsions. Staring straight into the empty, rolled-back eyes, Sanctella stepped closer, raising her voice into a shout. Taking the final step, she forced a vial into the creature’s mouth; once it was emptied, the thing let out an unbelievable scream and collapsed dead. \n\n Sanctella helped Vixit to her feet, and they left the village that had become a mass grave for hundreds of parishioners. After the events, the baroness ordered the remaining ruins of the settlement razed. \n\n Sometime later, the Coven was found again—on another day, in another place. And this time the baroness convinced them to meet Gytha in person."

I’ll be frank: I’m shocked.’  Gytha drew a breath, looked at the witches again, and leaned forward.’ You...  You are all truly heroines. But why did you never make yourselves known?’\n\n Purvita sighed sadly.’ All we ever wanted, dear queen, was peace.

Entering, he saw ponies sitting in a circle in similar cloaks—the figures accompanying him took their places among them. A Farbrook pony standing beside him waved a hoof, inviting Semper to sit opposite the one called Izelynn. The changeling began speaking in broken Farbrook speech, using an interpreter. \n\n ‘My name is Semper Fai, Guardian. I represent the Kingdom of Greneclyf on the island beyond the hills, and first of all allow me to sincerely thank you for the help Brookvale provided during the crisis that struck us. I know your community was deeply surprised to learn of changelings, but your kindness saved many.’ \n\n Izelynn listened to the interpreter, then nodded with a small chuckle. She babbled something and then held out a large mug of something fizzy to the counter-admiral. The changeling shot a questioning look at the interpreter. The interpreter gave only a faint nod, hinting that he should drink. Taking a sip, Semper felt a wave of calm—and the taste of something very natural...  and salty. \n\n Izelynn set down her own mug and also took a sip, showing she was ready to hear more. \n\n ‘But my queen is interested in a deeper friendship with your community, respected Guardian. We want...’  Semper hesitated, searching for a word the Brookvale ponies would understand instead of “integration,” ‘... to marry you?’\n\n Hearing the translation, Izelynn, cheeks faintly pink, flicked her ears in confusion, her gaze fixing on the counter-admiral—who was already thumping a hoof against his forehead as the meaning sank in. The advisers around her began whispering. \n\n ‘I...  I mean a state union, you understand?’ Semper swallowed nervously.’ T-that is, our two peoples will be like spouses to one another, t-that’s all...’ \n\n Izelynn rose from her place and looked the changeling over carefully, then said something to the council. After that she brought out fine mugs filled with water that was now pink. \n\n ‘What, do I have to drink something again?’ Semper asked the interpreter. The interpreter only shrugged, clearly hiding something in his gaze. \n\n The changeling was already preparing to drink when Izelynn began to feed him herself. Guessing instinctively, he returned the gesture. When the vessels were empty, the interpreter said briefly, ‘Congratulations.’ \n\n ‘For what?’\n\n ‘For your engagement.’ \n\n The counter-admiral’s eye twitched.

Tires shrieked, metal screamed—and the sedan’s body tore through the roadside barrier. \n\n Achoit was there before the last shards of glass finished scattering. Disguised as a pony, he wrenched the car door open and dragged out the politician, who didn’t even have time to scream. Once she was finally bound, Purple glanced once more at his “colleague.”\n\n The other was already walking toward them, taking the shape of a traffic inspector and acting as if he’d arrived to assess the crash. Everything followed the script—until a shot rang out alongside a rasping wheeze. Nobody was hit; Punch’s dying bodyguard dropped his pistol as the “inspector” approached, pressed a hoof to his nose, and listened for a moment to the wet, strangled gurgling. \n\n A second later Achoit vanished into an alley, carrying the politician on his back—this same pony who, only days ago, had spoken confidently about Deponia’s independence. He didn’t know what would happen to her. That wasn’t his job. His job was to leave the package where it needed to be. \n\n A week later the country shook. Caramel Punch—the nationalists’ symbol, their voice—suddenly changed her position. Now she spoke of unity, of the necessity of integration, of the time to forget the past for the sake of a common future. \n\n King Grimhoof listened. The people listened. And Achoit listened too, with an empty expression, waiting for the next call."

Few take us seriously, preferring to do business with republicans or princes.”\n\n “Oh, come now—your confederation is a model for other Coalition countries of what harmony should look like, Crimson. The only thing you lack is progress and industrialization, and we are more than willing to help you with that. As friends.”\n\n Crimson was slightly touched by such frank flattery, but kept her composure. “Tell me, Gytha...  I’m no stranger to understanding both friendship and trade customs. Harmony is built on mutual exchange, so tell me: how can I repay you for helping with industrialization?”\n\n Gytha brightened at how understanding the pony before her was. \n\n “Oh, nothing special—only that you recognize our friendship officially. Isn’t it wonderful when two countries can tell the whole world they care about each other and are ready to cover one another’s flank?”\n\n Crimson laughed at Gytha’s line of thought, taking a long sip of tea. “I like how that sounds.

Listen—their speech is weird.”\n\n At the sound of a shot, a Bakaran sailor burst from the cabin, looked from side to side, then began gesturing and shouting at the Equestrians in their language: “Calm down! These are representatives of the Kingdom of Greneclyf in the far East—our neighbors!”\n\n “Get that pony a medic, he’s obviously suffering from heatstroke.”\n\n “I’m telling the truth, you paranoid stubborn idiot—look!” He pointed at the flagstaff and at the ship’s papers filled out in Greneclyfian. \n\n The border guards exchanged glances. One spat and lowered his weapon. “Whatever. Stay here, Light Splash—I’ll call the police, let them sort it out. Maybe they really are some kind of Thoraxicans, and maybe they’re our friends.”\n\n Rifles lowered on both sides as Oiren drilled the insolent pony with her stare. \n\n That evening, after Equestrian military police escorted them to Vancouver City Hall, Princess Twilight Sparkle—and Celestia herself—arrived in the city on urgent notice. \n\n Oiren watched them with cool condescension, chin propped on her hoof, while Twilight examined her and the entourage—until Celestia began:\n\n “Greetings, Greneclyfians! It has been a long time since I last heard anything of you—so long that it seems nearly a thousand years have passed. Please forgive me for the actions of”—she turned her head toward the naval patrol captain—“my little ponies. You see, in our lands Greneclyf has long become the stuff of old scrolls, and even textbooks no longer mention that such a place exists. How have you been?”\n\n “How have we— Indeed. How have we been after your paranoiacs almost shot us? What was that, Princess Celestia—where did that aggression come from?!” Carrion snapped. \n\n “Greneclyfians...  a separate people... ” Twilight Sparkle murmured in surprise. “Allow me to give you a brief explanation of what has been happening on Equus over the last—um—hundred years.” Twilight hurried out and returned with books and a thick stack of scrolls, while Oiren’s eyes widened slightly at the sheer size of the manuscripts."

Ideologically, Equestria is close to us, and will most likely use our image in propaganda as that of a “good changeling.”\n\n Recommended: develop political relations while shifting public perception of our kind.

And you”—she pointed at Gytha—“are clearly a queen as well. What is going on..? Did Chrysalis decide to replace me?!”\n\n “Wait! Tell me—have you heard of a ruler named Queen Mirel the Mighty?”\n\n “What is this, a history lesson? There was such a queen in Ditrysium at the start of the last millennium. She ruled for a relatively short time before vanishing in yet another coup.”\n\n “You’re not her descendant?”\n\n “No. Maybe you’ll finally ex—”\n\n Gytha placed her hoof on Helvia’s gesturing hoof, holding a steady smile. “My name is Gytha Lehmann.

I’m curious what such a unique kinsling as you has to say.”\n\n “W-well... ,” the Queen of Greneclyf hesitated. “Honestly, I never expected the Hives to become a single state. You’ve clearly outdone yourself—managing to unite so many clans that used to squabble with each other.”\n\n Chrysalis flicked her forelock, plainly proud of herself. “And everything would be going wonderfully if it weren’t for those damned ponies in the east. We are hungry. We need the love those sickeningly saccharine creatures can give us—and we will take what we need by force. You should understand me better than anyone, Queen.”\n\n Everyone in the entourage shifted uneasily, making Chrysalis arch a brow. \n\n “How do I put this... ,” Shou began. \n\n “Do you know what the traders of Ditrysium were known for back in the day, Chrysalis?” Gytha asked. \n\n “For cunning. That’s why Vesalipolis made an axis with those leeches—bringing the rest to heel, right, Helvia?”\n\n “In a certain sense.”\n\n Gytha shook her head. “And cunning can be used in different ways.

If Greneclyf is alive, then in time they can become part of the Hegemony! Imagine it: connections, intercontinental smuggling, a united kind under MY banner! And besides—we won’t just rule Equus, we’ll squeeze Griffonia from both sides, dictating terms to the locals.”\n\n “Can I go now?” Helvia exhaled. “You dumped a mountain of tasks on me this morning.

Are you planning something?”\n\n “Actually, yes,” Oyrien nodded. “I have two proposals for this part of the Constitution. Option one: we keep the status quo, but codify it in law. In other words, full authority remains with the Queen, who decides herself what to approve and what to refuse. \n\n Option two: we introduce the institution of prime ministers. Gytha, you are doing too much—every queen needs a second official figure to lean on.

A few days earlier, malnourished and fatigued, Tinax had started coughing as they were on another unsuccessful fishing trip.  It was just a few days ago that Tinax had finally convinced Rudy to devote his life to the Matrona.  Now, their faces showed nothing anymore—their hunger and fatigue couldn’t even muster an expression of sorrow for their comrade. \n\n In the morning they moored at a rocky island to bury their companion. Rudy cast a glance at their last remaining fellow traveler—old Kerne, who, even during the burial, kept trying to fish in dead water. \n\n Charoite trudged toward him without a sound. Though he couldn’t put it into words, a desire was forming in his head to drown Kerne: the old stallion’s increasingly crazed obsession with fishing stirred an irresistible rage within him. \n\n He stepped beside the hunched figure and raised a stone—then noticed something remarkable, a bite.  For the first time in weeks something had taken the bait. With experienced precision, Kerne hauled in a large salmon, whose head Charoite crushed immediately. The three built a fire in silence, ravaged the fish, and finally found the strength to speak. \n\n “We have to tell the others, the hive needs food.” Rudy said, stirring the coals. \n\n Kerne only nodded silently, while Charoite grimaced. “If only we knew where we were. We just sailed north...”\n\n The old stallion nodded again, grumbling something unintelligible. \n\n “Let’s...  pray, for Tinax...” Rudy said, touching the cross of Matrona’s Church on his neck. \n\n After catching enough fish for several days’ travel and returning to Llir, the fishermen told of miracles in the northern icefields, of oceans full of enormous fish.  This brought a shine of hope, and prompted the authorities to take an interest in developing the region."

You see, in the modern world there are three primary concepts for developing a navy. The last is experimental and extraordinarily expensive to produce, so as the kingdom’s rear admiral, I propose we exclude it from consideration and focus on the first two.”\n\n Fai cleared his throat, catching the approving nods of the state’s leading figures, and set the folders before them. \n\n “The red folder represents a doctrine focused on perfecting our existing structure in light of contemporary realities.

What is it about?”\n\n Fai hesitated slightly. “An alternative plan—let’s call it a contingency. It proceeds from a deliberately cautious, if not defeatist, premise: that our fleet is insufficient for maritime dominance, and therefore we should focus on submarines and raider attacks against enemy shipping. I dislike this plan not only out of wounded pride, but because of its logic. The core resource base of our potential rivals lies on the continent, which means it will be difficult for us to deliver a decisive blow.

The generals insisted on introducing mandatory conscription for the kingdom’s citizens. \n\n “The floor is given to Aypex Carrion, Prefect of Blosmport and General of the Royal Guard,” Oyrien declared, watching the officer approach. \n\n “Greetings, most honorable deputies. Your Majesty.”\n\n Carrion swept the assembly with a stern gaze and began: “Before us stands the most important question: what should be the foundation of our army? The answer is obvious—we need a strong, disciplined, and numerous regular army built on conscription. \n\n First, state security cannot depend on a handful of elite soldiers. Wars are won by armies, not by a small band of heroes. We must know we have hundreds—thousands—of trained warriors ready to hold our borders. Second, conscription will strengthen our nation. Military service is a school of discipline, unity, and civic spirit. One who has served is not merely a soldier—he is a patriot, ready to defend his homeland when danger comes. \n\n We cannot afford to build our defense on a narrow circle of people. We need a nation under arms, not chosen knights. I urge you to support the doctrine of a regular army and conscription! Only so can we guarantee the security of our country and its citizens.”\n\n “Your position has been heard, Prefect. Time,” Oyrien struck her gavel, dismissing the bowing officer. “The floor is given to General of the Leib Guard, Bermondt Latro.”\n\n A statuesque officer in the black uniform of his regiment stepped to the rostrum, bearing its distinctive insignia. He removed his cap and extended it broadly in greeting. \n\n “Worthy sirs! Beloved Queen! The world has changed, and war has changed with it. The time of numbers is over; the time of quality has come. The army of the future is mobile, highly trained elite units—capable of lightning strikes and solving tasks that ordinary infantry would not even understand. \n\n The elite is a force that acts precisely and efficiently. A regular army is a mass that must be fed, clothed, and armed. A regular army requires oversight, which means a heavy burden on the kingdom’s bureaucracy—and that means corruption and negligence in the ranks. \n\n Conflicts today are not endless fronts and enormous armies. They are special operations, sabotage, speed. Who will handle that better—an elite soldier trained to perfection, or a conscript who has barely learned how to hold a weapon?\n\n Not to mention: no discipline is sufficient to bring order to forcibly herded masses, in each of whom sleeps a rapist and villain, a coward and parasite—ready to betray his comrades at arms. My reform plan is a path to victories, not to senseless losses.”\n\n After the speeches, the Eryahtas began to vote. The deciding vote belonged to Lord Shou, who chose..."

Sentence to be carried out immediately. Anyone who refuses will receive fifteen blows himself.”\n\n Whimpering, Bromum stumbled backward, but the political officer kicked him forward sharply. Others raised their ramrods, preparing to strike. \n\n Lory hesitated. Watching Bromum writhing in pain, he remembered how he hadn’t slept all night because of that idiotic alarm.

Still, someone knew far more about him than they should have. \n\n Kulicid’s gaze lingered on the weapons. A longing seized him—for the days when he had been needed, and for the idea that had been worth risking his life for.

Do you even understand what will happen if Chrysalis finds out?”\n\n Shou turned away, staring off to the side. \n\n “Madam von Ditrysium, I am not Lady Gytha. I cannot play on others’ emotions and steer this conversation toward a place where you accept reality with joy—so I ask you, simply listen. Adler is involved. Greneclyf guarantees your safety if the plan is exposed. At present we are also cooperating with Thoraxian cells, so you will have support. You have a central role in this plan: the—ahem—Madam President sees you as the future Queen of the Hives. Please, we need your help.”\n\n “You’re all such selfish creatures... ” Helvia said bitterly. “I don’t love Chrysalis, but what right do you have to dump such responsibility on me—to break my current life... ”\n\n She turned away from Shou, clearly unwilling to look at him. \n\n “I don’t know how you got my brother to participate.

And one of the most important things is this: personality—though it matters—decides very little in politics. Chrysalis had a cabinet, and Synoval’s cabinet is our cabinet. Our agents are there. Our elite. In practice, his charming nationalist country is being run by our harmonists—and we’ll be able to teach them to behave. In time. We can’t squeeze them now.

But when the news of the massacre of her changeling kin and the stories of refugees reached her, the only thing she could think about was saving her blood—and making the occupier pay. \n\n She still disliked the idea of dialogue with Synoval, but Gytha’s words about the government calmed her.

The Queen of Ditrysium was clearly grateful that Gytha had not exploited the uprising plan and forced her compatriots to kill one another, though she regretted that the country was no longer united. Gytha was beginning to think that with peace restored, not all that much had truly changed—except... \n\n Asking the guards to leave, the President stepped right up to the bars. The same greenish mane, emerald eyes, graceful long neck—and that same sense of superiority. \n\n “... ”\n\n “Nothing to say, is there?”\n\n The figure on the other side of the bars turned her head slightly, staring at the President. \n\n “I thought for a long time why you didn’t kill me. I thought you were soft,” she smirked, her eyes flashing with a half-mad smile. “But I understood. At last, I understood—when I saw your Federation. \n\n You aren’t soft. Oh no. You’re far from it. Of the two of us, you’re the more frightening one, Lemann. \n\n I was clumsy. I united them, but my pillars were fear and parades. And you? You made them believe in you, became their icon, and washed the brains not only of ponies but of every other living creature in your magnificently disgusting project. They fear me for a reason; they fear you only if they understand your power. And perhaps that’s what you’re trying to achieve—among other things, even from me,” the figure began to laugh, and her eyes seemed to throb. “I hate you for destroying my project, and yet I admire the grandeur of yours. Maybe it will grow into an obsession. You’re brilliant. You planted the idea in their heads that changelings will rule them—and they will be happy about it!”\n\n Gytha twisted her mouth. \n\n “We’re not the same. Why did I even come here to waste time on a senile madmare? I don’t even understand why I didn’t hand you over to the Equestrians. But it doesn’t matter now. Enjoy your eternal vacation.”\n\n The President left the prison, still hearing in her head the echoes of the mad laughter of the proud mare who had once welcomed her in her country—a country her guest later helped destroy. \n\n Is there truly a resemblance between them? Is that what Oiren meant back then... ?"

### Obsidian trade ###

greneclyf_obsidian.2.t:0 "Our ambassadors return not just empty-handed - they return insulted."

greneclyf_obsidian.2.d:0 "Their finance minister stated that he "sees no strategic value in fragile trinkets," while military advisors whispered something about "unreliable supplies from an unstable region." This crude display of arrogance clearly shows how we are perceived abroad — as provincial supplicants, not equal partners.\n\nA tomb-like silence reigns in the Royal Palace, broken only by the angry chime of crystal ornaments. Our reserves will remain unused, and our modernization plans — frozen. But at least now we know for sure who our friend is, and who is merely looking for weaknesses in our defenses. But who, if not Greneclyf, understands that today's adversaries are tomorrow's partners?"

greneclyf_obsidian.2.a:0 "Damn it."

greneclyf_obsidian.3.d:0 "Our diplomats have returned from their long journey with radiant smiles and a thick portfolio of documents. The negotiations, which lasted for several weeks, have finally been crowned with success. The government of $COUNTRY$ saw mutual benefit in our proposal.\n\nStarting today, regular shipments of first-grade crystal obsidian will commence by sea. In return, steel, magical crystals, or grain (depending on the partner country) will flow into our storages. This treaty is not just an economic exchange. It is a bridge built between our peoples. May the cold gleam of our stone be warmed in the fire of their forges, and may their technology strengthen the radiance of our spires!"
