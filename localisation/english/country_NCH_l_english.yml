### FOCUSES ###
# Pre crisis #

NCH_legacy:0 "The Legacy of Eithne"
NCH_legacy_desc:0 "The glorious Queen Eithne of Clann Óir left us last year, having brought the country into the age of steam engines, machinery, and railways by sheer force of will. Though the hives gained much from her reforms, there were downsides as well... "

NCH_divided_house:0 "A House Divided"
NCH_divided_house_desc:0 "Though Gytha had been prepared for the throne since youth, she had rarely ventured beyond Blosmport. To witness firsthand the realities of life in the hives and gain a true understanding of the struggles and desires of the common drone, the queen made the decision to embark on a small tour across the island, accompanied by Lady Oiren."

NCH_parliament_convocation:0 "The Summoning of the Oireachtas"
NCH_parliament_convocation_desc:0 "Since ancient times, the Queens of Greneclyf have relied on the Oireachtas – an analogue of parliament closely tied to the Church. Now, the time had come for the first summoning of this body under the new queen. Long and turbulent discussions lay ahead, during which Gytha and her advisors would determine the nation's future for years to come."

NCH_Spy_experience:0 "Study the Recent Experiences"
NCH_Spy_experience_desc:0 "In the 970s, Eithne introduced the practice of infiltrating the societies of various nations in Griffonia, allowing our citizens to study at local universities and gather information about the outside world. Just before her death, the latest graduates returned, and their experiences must now be utilized to help develop the kingdom."

NCH_new_housing:0 "New Housing?"
NCH_new_housing_desc:0 "Overpopulation has created an unforeseen problem: our residents no longer have enough space in the hive cities. We lack both the resources and time to build an entire new hive, but one of the graduates from the architecture faculty of Aquila has an interesting proposal..."

NCH_find_they_job:0 "Find Them Work!"
NCH_find_they_job_desc:0 "Facing two problems – education and unemployment – some economists have concluded that a profitable solution could be found for both by directing the unemployed to build schools on the outskirts of Bugsmere and Blosmport. If the experiment succeeds, it will be the first step towards the urbanization of the island and solving the unemployment issue."

NCH_lift_the_veil:0 "Lift the Veil"
NCH_lift_the_veil_desc:0 "800 years ago, we signed the Great Agreements with Farbrook, and it seems the trade season has come once more. However, after Eithne’s modernization, it feels like the fishermen have little to offer us besides, well... fish. I only hope Cenhelm won’t take offense at our merchants’ lack of enthusiasm."

NCH_learn_from_mistakes:0 "Learning from Mistakes"
NCH_learn_from_mistakes_desc:0 "One of the greatest challenges of the past was that Eithne’s reforms... outpaced the state of our society. Prefect Carrion has proposed the formation of the Nation’s Birth Movement, an initiative aimed at retraining our citizens and shedding the habits of the old way of life. He justifies the name by arguing that our past society was not truly national, but rather communal in nature. Perhaps his approach will succeed, opening one of many doors to our future?"

NCH_typography:0 "The Establishment of the State Printing House"
NCH_typography_desc:0 "Until now, Greneclyf had never had a standardized printing press. Even during Eithne’s era of change, this phase was skipped, as information was seen as something military or noble, but never truly public. Our soldiers relay messages via telegraph, yet our citizens cannot even read the latest news. It is time to change that."

NCH_take_look_around:0 "Take a Look Around"
NCH_take_look_around_desc:0 "Strangely enough, the River Coalition isn’t even aware of our existence! Despite being just a strait away from Bakara, the turbulent waters and rumors of necromancers have always deterred ponies from exploring the north. Our traders could start doing business with them by blending in as Farbrookers and prospectors – let’s see if this gamble pays off. After all, it’s unlikely the locals are prepared to meet a changeling in all their glory..."

NCH_Esteblish_trade_guild:0 "Founding the Trade Guild"
NCH_Esteblish_trade_guild_desc:0 "The era when our trade relied solely on artisans and enthusiasts has passed – now, it is dominated by the owners of manufactories and the so-called "capitalists," as they are known in Griffonia. To facilitate state coordination of this wealthy stratum of society and to direct their activities in service of the kingdom, Oireachtas have decided to establish the Trade Guild and implement a universal enterprise registration system."

NCH_time_to_look_further:0 "Time to Look Beyond"
NCH_time_to_look_further_desc:0 "Her Majesty Gytha has done well in handling the initial struggles of the kingdom she inherited. Well then, time to see how the state is faring."


# Crisis #
NCH_beginning_of_crisis:0 "The Inevitable"
NCH_beginning_of_crisis_desc:0 "It has happened again. The Second Great Famine has crashed down upon us like a relentless wave, and storm clouds have swallowed the island whole. Matron preserve us..."

NCH_to_neighbors:0 "The End of Hide and Seek"
NCH_to_neighbors_desc:0 "Circumstances force Greneclyf to reveal its face far sooner than planned. Not only must we seek aid from our old friends in the hills, but we must also finally make our presence known to the Coalition."

NCH_reguest_of_help:0 "Meeting with Trade Emissaries"
NCH_reguest_of_help_desc:0 "The Coalition representatives showed reserved curiosity after meeting with our envoys. As a gesture of goodwill and a step toward negotiations, the Queen herself wishes to meet them in person. Let’s hope this leaves an impression."

NCH_army_concessions:0 "Saor SEZ"
NCH_army_concessions_desc:0 "The establishment of the so-called ‘Saor Special Economic Zone’ was one of the Coalition emissaries' key demands. In simple terms, the river ponies would lease part of Aisling from us, constructing port facilities at their own expense and expanding their businesses, benefiting both their economy and ours by creating a lucrative trading hub. On paper, it all sounded promising – but how would it play out in reality?"

NCH_concessions_for_help:0 "Saor Police Department"
NCH_concessions_for_help_desc:0 "To maintain order in Saor, the United River Company demanded to deploy its own private police regiment. It seems that if the river nations ever stand united, it is only when their shared wealth is at stake..."

NCH_every_friend:0 "Send the Ambassador to Farbrook"
NCH_every_friend_desc:0 "The Queen ordered the special envoy to be sent to the Farbrook tribes. Despite their meager catch this year, our citizens still desperately need not just regular sustenance, but also the love the hill-ponies have provided us since the signing of the Great Agreements."

NCH_hoof_of_help:0 "Hoof of Aid"
NCH_hoof_of_help_desc:0 "The hills are not sustained by Farbrook alone: intelligence has spotted two other communities to the west – Watertowns and Firtree Villages. It would be wise to offer them friendship, especially now when there is little choice."

NCH_some_love:0 "Love Affairs"
NCH_some_love_desc:0 "Gytha came up with quite an unusual solution for how she could bring more love to her homeland. Perhaps, even a bit too unusual."

NCH_overvise_great_packt:0 "Review of the Great Agreements"
NCH_overvise_great_packt_desc:0 "Our old treaties with Farbrook are no longer sufficient in the modern world. Now that we’ve opened our lands to the River Nations, it is time to forge new agreements to stay afloat amidst capitalist chaos."

NCH_mre_cards:0 "Introduction of Rations"
NCH_mre_cards_desc:0 "Swift action is required. Wicksite is sharp-minded, and she has already determined the course of action for the Grove – we shall follow her example. An official rationing system will be implemented across the kingdom, distributing food via vouchers. Additionally, a curfew will be imposed in the evenings to prevent unrest."

NCH_limit_external_trade:0 "Expanding Obsidian Exports"
NCH_limit_external_trade_desc:0 "Our island is rich in minerals, but none as abundant as volcanic glass – obsidian. Other nations lack the knowledge to utilize this resource effectively. That is why we will not only sell it abroad but also dispatch our own experts, trained in its diverse applications – from medicine to construction."

NCH_agroindustrial_mobilization:0 "New Agricultural Methods"
NCH_agroindustrial_mobilization_desc:0 "The Sacred Grove, our great granary, suffered from the disastrous experiment conducted by agrarians trained in the Valley of Evi. To swiftly provide bread for our citizens, we will import and cultivate resilient crops from the Riverlands. Baroness Wicksite will make every effort to expedite the harvest."

NCH_modernization_industry:0 "Decoupling from the Gold Standard"
NCH_modernization_industry_desc:0 "During Eithne’s reign, our currency was tied to the so-called “gold standard”. However, the experience of our agents and hired advisors suggests that in the current situation – where Greneclyf’s economy is growing due to anti-crisis mobilization – it is imperative to transition to a GDP-pegged currency. Naturally, this process will be carried out under the strict supervision of the Treasury."

NCH_industrial_cooperatives:0 "The Eithne Royal Institute"
NCH_industrial_cooperatives_desc:0 "We lack a broad foundation for educational reforms, yet circumstances demand immediate action. By royal decree, the Queen announces the establishment of the first two faculties of the future university within the grand halls of the Blosmport Central Library – Economics and Natural Sciences. This is our first necessary step toward forming a national intellectual elite."

NCH_agroindustrial_programs:0 "Redistributing Surpluses"
NCH_agroindustrial_programs_desc:0 "A small surplus has accumulated in our food reserves. It must be distributed among the population – but in such a way that maximizes the kingdom’s benefit in the current situation."

NCH_domestic_consumption:0 "Cover Domestic Consumption"
NCH_domestic_consumption_desc:0 "We endured! Under Gytha’s rule, we have weathered the crisis, preventing famine before it could take root and averting catastrophe. Now that the worst has passed, it is time to address the social issues that have unexpectedly surfaced amidst the turmoil..."

NCH_emergacy_plan:0 "Emergency Measures"
NCH_emergacy_plan_desc:0 "Following an emergency convocation of the Oireachtas, a unanimous decision was reached: a State of Emergency will be declared across the entire nation. Industries will be mobilized, and security around the agricultural sector will be tightened. There is much work ahead. "

NCH_call_for_unity:0 "Deploying Propaganda"
NCH_call_for_unity_desc:0 "In these difficult times, the printing presses under Gagat’s management have found their most crucial role yet – to become the voice of stability and the will of the Queen. The newly established Office of Information and Propaganda, operating within the Chancellery, will immediately begin shaping the narrative to reassure the population, spreading its message through the newspapers."

NCH_consolidation_political:0 "Securing the Church’s Support"
NCH_consolidation_political_desc:0 "A longstanding ally of the Crown in Greneclyf is the Church of Lady Matron – the oldest religious institution in the nation, established shortly after the Leamhan and Óir dynasties solidified the governance system known as ‘Athsholáthar Cothrom’. In these times of crisis, it is only prudent to seek aid from Actino, the influential Praetor of Blosmport."

NCH_clans_of_Greneclyf:0 "Declare Martial Law"
NCH_clans_of_Greneclyf_desc:0 "Radicals and dissenters are planning an unauthorized rally in the capital. Gytha has ordered Prefect Carrion to take up defensive positions and prepare the soldiers. With her sanction secured, Oiren declares a temporary state of martial law. The island holds its breath..."

NCH_suppression_of_unrest:0 "Lancing the Boil"
NCH_suppression_of_unrest_desc:0 "According to a long-term investigation conducted by our esteemed Lord Protector and the secret service, an entire underground network of elements hostile to the Crown has been operating within our nation, scheming to plunge us into a bloody civil war for their own gain. To prevent brother from turning against brother, we must purge the kingdom of these parasites."

NCH_final_crisis:0 "Clear Skies Over Greneclyf"
NCH_final_crisis_desc:0 "The famine has been halted, and son has not turned against father. Queen Gytha has saved us from the Second Great Famine, yet the crisis has forever changed both Greneclyf and the monarch herself. The future remains uncertain, but for now, we can let out a sigh of relief."


### MAINT PATCH ###
# Gytha reforms patch #
NCH_reforms_after_storm:0 "Continue Eithne’s Path"
NCH_reforms_after_storm_desc:0 "With the crisis behind us, we cannot afford complacency. The time has come to continue the reforms that will ensure our nation never again teeters on the brink of disaster: never again shall the specter of another Great Famine haunt our land."

NCH_patch_to_prosperty:0 "Royal Decrees"
NCH_patch_to_prosperty_desc:0 "To address the lingering social tensions, Oiren has drafted and passed the first wave of post-crisis royal decrees, approved by the Oireachtas. The Office of Information and Propaganda stands ready to disseminate the news far and wide, printing proclamations from Her Majesty’s hoof through the presses of Gagat, heralding yet more change to come."

NCH_health_care_reform:0 "Mandatory Insurance"
NCH_health_care_reform_desc:0 "Every citizen of the kingdom must know that their life and health are protected. From now on, no worker shall die in poverty, drowning in debt for medical care."

NCH_education_reform:0 "Eradicate Illiteracy"
NCH_education_reform_desc:0 "One of the key problems of overpopulation is the shortage of schools, especially in rural areas. It is time to act: expand existing schools and promote the creation of reading circles in libraries across the country."

NCH_civil_rights_reform:0 "Expand North and South"
NCH_civil_rights_reform_desc:0 "We need new lands to relieve pressure on our overpopulated regions. Wicksite proposes large-scale urbanization projects in the Sacred Grove and Aisling, learning from the experience of Bugsmere to avoid ecological destruction. With the advice of Prefect Berilla and Chief Architect Valga, she’s likely to succeed."

NCH_blosmport_hive:0 "Institute Opening"
NCH_blosmport_hive_desc:0 "The Eithne Royal Institute finally sheds its provisional status and becomes a full-fledged university with a wide array of departments. Learning is not only light – it is freedom! "

NCH_birth_control:0 "Birth Control"
NCH_birth_control_desc:0 "The larger the population – the better, but even prosperity must have its limits. Overpopulation has become a threat, and we must slow the growth rate. A new law introduces fines for third and subsequent children. Regrettably, this is a necessary step."

NCH_new_instituts:0 "Cult of Progress"
NCH_new_instituts_desc:0 "We are destined to move only forward – toward the future, where our kingdom rightfully belongs! Our goal: to build a welfare society and foster progressive ideals in the hearts of all citizens."

NCH_traditional_way_of_life:0 "Social Conservatism"
NCH_traditional_way_of_life_desc:0 "The state must care for its people, but this can only be done by a truly patriotic government. A civil servant must not be a cosmopolitan – he is a servant of the nation. It is Matron, our laws, and the nation itself that guide society forward, not blind faith in abstract ideals."

NCH_first_constitution:0 "End of the Schism"
NCH_first_constitution_desc:0 "After the death of the last Cardinal, the Church has spent ten years in disarray, unable to agree on who should become the new Herald of Matron. This three-way schism has dragged on too long. It is time to end this barren dispute. By royal prerogative, we shall appoint a new Cardinal and restore unity to the faith."

NCH_from_chaos:0 "Benevolent Rule"
NCH_from_chaos_desc:0 "A monarch is responsible for their people. Gytha studied history, and one of the most instructive events on the continent was the revolution in the Griffon Empire, which led to civil war and the fall of its hegemon. To avoid such mistakes, we will begin a partial integration of republican institutions into the monarchy."

NCH_form_new_govermant:0 "Ideas from the Right"
NCH_form_new_govermant_desc:0 "Beakolini’s ideas may seem exotic, but there is a rational core we can adopt: a corporative organization of the state. Of course, we have no need for fascist aesthetics, but from now on the lower chamber of Oireachtas will consist of scholars, workers, and military personnel, while the upper chamber will become an elected body."

NCH_reflecting_the_past:0 "Ideas from the Left"
NCH_reflecting_the_past_desc:0 "After dispersing the Marksists, our state has firmly taken the path of anti-communism, but excessive pressure may lead to new unrest and revolutions. To prevent social upheaval, we will create a system of state unions and officially enshrine the eight-hour workday. From now on, no manufactory lord in Bugsmere will dare exploit the workers, and the demon of Marksism will no longer whisper them false hopes."

NCH_to_the_new_order:0 "The First Constitution"
NCH_to_the_new_order_desc:0 "After many years of preparation, Oiren has finally completed her work: we now have a draft of the first Constitution of the Kingdom of Greneclyf. The time has come to hear its key provisions and ratify this historic document. "

NCH_save_clans_system:0 "Status Quo"
NCH_save_clans_system_desc:0 "A historic decision was made: the monarch is now legally established as the full head of the executive branch. From now on, the queen will always be able to choose the nation's path, while Oireachtas will either support these changes or serve as a wise counterbalance."

NCH_hereditary_monarchy:0 "Scales and Scepter"
NCH_hereditary_monarchy_desc:0 "Gytha made her decision: the Kingdom of Greneclyf would adopt a previously foreign institution – the office of Prime Minister. The monarch will personally appoint the prime minister for a four-year term, and the queen already knew exactly whom she would choose. The time had come to make her choice official."

NCH_economic_revival:0 "Economic Boom"
NCH_economic_revival_desc:0 "During the crisis, the kingdom mobilized its economy and received a surge of investment from the Riverlands. This led to a sharp rise in production and a rapid expansion of trade. Our economy is now overheated, but we have the opportunity to use our resources wisely and seize the moment to lead Greneclyf into true prosperity!"

NCH_businesses_do_not_stand_idle:0 "Buy Back Saor"
NCH_businesses_do_not_stand_idle_desc:0 "The Saor Special Economic Zone has fulfilled its purpose and must return to its rightful harbor. Naturally, this won’t come cheap, but Ulysses is our city, not a possession of the United River Company. Time to close the deal."

NCH_bee_productivity:0 "Project ‘Apis’"
NCH_bee_productivity_desc:0 "‘Apis’ is a unique experimental supplement for changelings, developed by scientist Franser Celarl. This innovation boosts productivity and concentration. At the next Oireachtas session, Franser will present his project"

NCH_brood_of_working_drones:0 "Plan ‘Formicidae’"
NCH_brood_of_working_drones_desc:0 "Greneclyf is not limitless, and even after developing Aisling or the Sacred Grove, the population will keep growing. Xylocopa Valga has unveiled the so-called ‘Formicidae Plan’ – an ambitious architectural blueprint for subterranean civilian infrastructure. This initiative doesn’t just resolve spatial constraints; it also holds major strategic significance. In the event that war ever reaches our doorstep, these underground cities would be able to withstand any bombardment."

NCH_ensure_full_employment:0 "The Invisible Hoof of the Market"
NCH_ensure_full_employment_desc:0 "No one in our government trusts the concept of a free market, especially after the actions of the United River Company. That’s why the Eithne Royal Institute has proposed two competing visions to guide the nation’s economic thought: ‘Eastern Phoenix’ and ‘Harmonic Solidarism’.."

NCH_gaining_economic_power:0 "Middle-Class Support"
NCH_gaining_economic_power_desc:0 "The middle class is the backbone of any civilized nation. The more citizens who belong to it, the more stable our society becomes. The government must do everything in its power to ensure that the majority of Greneclyf's population not only survives, but thrives."

NCH_mobilizing_the_economy:0 "Eastern Phoenix"
NCH_mobilizing_the_economy_desc:0 "‘Eastern Phoenix’ is a model of centralized market statism, where the economy is built on exports, industrialization, and firm government control over strategic sectors. The state plays an active role in shaping the market, creating favorable conditions for production and entrepreneurship. Through regulation of the private sector, the government guides economic activity toward boosting domestic industry and securing a strong position in global trade."

NCH_economics_of_friendship:0 "Harmonic Solidarism"
NCH_economics_of_friendship_desc:0 "‘Harmonic Solidarism’ is an economic framework based on cooperation and the common good, inspired by principles of harmony and the canon of the Church of the Matron. At its core lies cooperative ownership and interclass social partnership. Planning becomes key, not as rigid command economy, but as a method of organizing production and resource allocation to ensure stability and fairness. This system aims to cultivate a balanced economy rooted in solidarity and shared prosperity."

# Gytha diplomatic patch #
NCH_we_are_not_alone:0 "We Are Not Alone"
NCH_we_are_not_alone_desc:0 "The events of the recent crisis have made one thing clear: the age of blissful isolation is over. The time has come to introduce the world to Greneclyf with both the quill and the sword at the ready."

NCH_new_opportunities:0 "Eastward Gaze"
NCH_new_opportunities_desc:0 "To the East lies a continent torn by wars and strife, ruled by violence and haunted by weeping ghosts of the past. Yet even there, we glimpse a light of hope – the River Coalition. It is becoming clear that our fate will be entwined with that of the river ponies. The only question is: how closely?"

NCH_our_mission:0 "Westward Gaze"
NCH_our_mission_desc:0 "Beyond the impassable glaciers and straits lies our true homeland – Equus. For nearly a thousand years, not a single changeling hoof of the Leamhan or Oiren lines has touched its soil, but we know with certainty: Equestria still stands. We must reach out and see what has become of our ancestral lands. Surely, the ponies will welcome changelings... won’t they?"

NCH_neighborhood:0 "Good Neighborliness"
NCH_neighborhood_desc:0 "During the crisis, we discovered that beyond the Farbrook tribes, two other pony communities dwell in the hills: Watertowns and the Firtree Villages. We must turn our attention to them, secure our influence, and... civilize them."

NCH_another_visit:0 "A Loyal Friend in the Hills"
NCH_another_visit_desc:0 "Among the hills, one community has caught the Queen’s special attention – Watertowns. Sacred springs, rich in mineral waters, and an almost miraculous peaceful coexistence make this quasi-state the most stable in the region. It is precisely for this reason that we must earn the trust of Keeper Eathelin."

NCH_pacts_exchange_for_support:0 "Offering Friendship"
NCH_pacts_exchange_for_support_desc:0 "We will officially extend an offer of friendship to the hillponies, promising aid with industrialization and education in exchange for their loyalty and support, both now and in the years to come. In doing so, we aim to renew the Great Pacts of old. Let us see how they respond."

NCH_long_cooperation:0 "Reaping the Rewards"
NCH_long_cooperation_desc:0 "With a firm foothold now secured in the region, it is time to draft a proper plan for integrating the hills into the Kingdom. Gytha will not take kindly to rejection: if the locals spurn our friendship, we may need to... guide them toward acceptance."

NCH_not_so_different:0 "Not So Different After All"
NCH_not_so_different_desc:0 "It’s done. The hillponies have embraced us. This joyous event proves that our values are not so distant after all. A new community shall rise from this union united in purpose, bound by friendship. Let the world witness what true harmony looks like."

NCH_bring_them_harmony:0 "Turns Out, We Are Different"
NCH_bring_them_harmony_desc:0 "Necromancers, warlords, heathens, savages... The hills turned out to be far more dangerous and fractured than we had anticipated. In response, Commander Semper Phi has issued an executive decree ordering the forcible deportation of extremist elements to the uninhabited wastes of the far north. One way or another, harmony will return here."

NCH_new_great_agreement:0 "Continental Prefectures"
NCH_new_great_agreement_desc:0 "Under the command of Semper Phi, our navy has achieved a glorious victory, expanding the borders of Greneclyf nearly threefold. Now begins the task of integrating the newly acquired Prefectures, and colonizing the sparsely populated zones with the utmost respect for local communities. The work of true statecraft is just beginning."


# LEFT #
NCH_river_pf_opportunity:0 "River of Opportunities"
NCH_river_pf_opportunity_desc:0 "The governments of the Riverlands are guided by the noblest of ideals – the dream of unity. We know the eastern ponies dream of a federated future. But not all share this dream sincerely. Among their number are opportunists and warmongers, eager to bind nations together by force to serve their own plutocratic interests. We will not let them twist this dream – or drown it in innocent blood."

NCH_peaceful_coexistence:0 "Peaceful Coexistence"
NCH_peaceful_coexistence_desc:0 "We are guided by love, just like any truly enlightened creature of this world. The clever minds of this realm have a word for this path: pacifism. And that is the policy we intend to follow with the Coalition. After all, is a peaceful sky not the dream of every generation?"

NCH_trade_development:0 "Developing Trade"
NCH_trade_development_desc:0 "The United River Company is not the same as the national economies of the riverponies. Despite a difficult history – including the shadow of Saor – we are now ready to speak as equals. A fair and open dialogue promises enormous benefits to both sides."

NCH_open_up_the_shopping_districts:0 "The Golden Crescent"
NCH_open_up_the_shopping_districts_desc:0 "One way to demonstrate our goodwill is to propose a joint naval operation with the coastal nations: a campaign to secure the region’s sea routes once and for all from monsters, pirates, and the warlocks of Magehold. Due to the glacial constraints of the western straits, this route will arc around the continent, forming a safe and lasting corridor for merchants from Zebrica and Griffonia."

NCH_scout_the_situation:0 "Assess the Situation"
NCH_scout_the_situation_desc:0 "Unfortunately, not all ponies in the Coalition are friendly toward changelings. Some remain deeply entrenched in xenophobic traditions – clinging to their old fears and viewing us as threats rather than allies."

NCH_visit_to_riverlands:0 "Embassy in Dail Mhòr"
NCH_visit_to_riverlands_desc:0 "We have officially opened an embassy in Dail Mhòr, the heart of Pònaidhean An Taigh Fada. This is no ordinary diplomatic mission – it is a strategic statement. In a fractured Coalition where some still flirt with extremism and autocracy, Pònaidhean stands as a rare bastion of peaceful harmony. The tribal structure may complicate negotiations, but its stability is exactly what we need."

NCH_cit_thrpugh_the_bureaurcracy:0 "Bureaucratic Maze"
NCH_cit_thrpugh_the_bureaurcracy_desc:0 "Amendment A39 of the Coltstream Pact outlines the prerequisites for any state seeking to sign it: shared borders with the Alliance and a legitimate, non-tyrannical government. Additional conditions include: receiving guarantees from Pact members, being a part of the Coalition, or being a military ally engaged in a common war alongside Pact nations."

NCH_embed_agents_in_goverments:0 "Operation ‘Patriots’"
NCH_embed_agents_in_goverments_desc:0 "Some ponies are extremely unhappy with our attempts to establish contact with the river ponies.

There would be no conscription – only volunteers, true professionals who devoted their lives to the art of war. A soldier is not a peasant in uniform. He is a weapon honed to perfection.

NCH_colony_development:0 "Special-Type Settlements"
NCH_colony_development_desc:0 "With the hasty construction of polar stations, we've gained a foothold for further expansion. While caution remains paramount, some voices have proposed building small towns around the stations. Blubber and fishing can provide a degree of self-sufficiency, and the scientific opportunities offered by improved station conditions may well justify the cost."

NCH_trade_in_snow_desc:0 "The sea offers more than fish: blubber, petrochemicals, marine flora, and rare minerals. These can be harvested not only for Greneclyf’s needs but exported on an industrial scale. Still, restraint is essential – nature and ecological balance must not be sacrificed."

NCH_rethinking_history_desc:0 "The changeling lands have fallen under the enemy’s boot. We expected Equestria, but it was not their banners that trampled our hives.

NCH_loyal_elite_desc:0 "Alongside the common folk, Chrysalis’ officers, soldiers, and nobles have crossed our border. Adler has met with his sister – her account of the war was horrifying. Carrion listens to the veterans, organizes relief, speaks to them... We must help them carry the pain."

NCH_our_legarl_right:0 "Condemn the Occupation"
NCH_our_legarl_right_desc:0 "It is our duty as changelings to condemn this brutal violation of international law on the soil of our kin.

NCH_all_or_nothing:0 "Vendetta"
NCH_all_or_nothing_desc:0 "Vengeance. That is the fire driving our kin who fled the occupied territories.

NCH_after_war_plans_desc:0 "Princess Celestia and Twilight Sparkle have proposed a high-level summit in Blosmport to discuss the postwar settlement of the occupied Hive territories. We have ideas. We have contacts. It's time to see what common ground can be found with the Equestrians."

NCH_collective_management:0 "Peace Walkers"
NCH_collective_management_desc:0 "The negotiations in Canterlot... did not go as smoothly as we had hoped. None dared to dispute the conference's conclusions, but Equestria’s military opposed the idea of a unified federative Hive state. Instead, they insist on the second plan: the creation of two regimes, divided by a demarcation line between our spheres of influence. "

NCH_burnings_they_hearts:0 "Social stabilization"
NCH_burnings_they_hearts_desc:0 "From now on, our brethren once again have a home where they can live and prosper under our wise guidance and counsel. For now, society is focused on a single fact: the war is over, and we can finally breathe again.

greneclyf_base.1.t:0 "A Foggy Evening"
greneclyf_base.1.d:0 "Gytha slowly browsed through last year’s reports and old newspapers, striving to get the most accurate understanding of the country she had inherited.\n\n‘Luddites, Luddites, Luddites... It feels like there weren’t nearly as many of them when I was younger, were there?’ The queen gazed wistfully out the window, frowning at the gathering storm clouds.\n\n‘Perhaps that is the price of progress. What’s the earliest record of people protesting against machines? The ’90s? Holy Matron, I was but a tiny grub back then! In just a single generation, Eithne managed to change the face of society so radically...’ Gytha studied the raindrops forming on the glass, reflecting on how the old nation of shared labor had swiftly transformed into a divided society of guilds, manufactories, elites, and paupers.\n\n‘Your Majesty?’ Lord Protector Basalt Shaw stepped into the study, awkwardly tapping his hoof against the open door. ‘Is something troubling you?’\n\n‘It appears industrialization is not an unquestionable blessing. I never even considered how many jobs the Griffonian looms had taken away! And the Luddites...’\n\n‘Say the word, and the guards will deal with them, Lady Gytha.’\n\n‘No. Absolutely not. They are my little subjects, innocent and starving workers whose means of livelihood were taken from them. No force must be used against the suffering. We took their jobs – it is our duty to make amends. I... I’ll come up with something at the Oireachtas assembly. This is our first and most pressing issue,’ Gytha declared firmly, her eyes darting over the lines describing how unemployment had led to the wealth of new industrialists and the destitution of common drones.\n\n‘And you – why did you come? Do you have business with me?’\n\nShaw nodded with a neutral expression. ‘The Royal Guard. As the new commander-in-chief, I have some proposals for modernizing our army, but since you mentioned the Oireachtas, it will be decided there. I won’t trouble you further.’\n\nThe Lord Protector had already turned to leave but suddenly halted, as if recalling something.\n\n‘Her Excellency, Lady Chief Justice Oiren, asked me to inform you that she wishes to meet you in the library this evening. What shall I tell her?’\n\nGytha had been preoccupied with the thought of being involved in military modernization, but the familiar name pulled her out of her trance.\n\n‘Oiren?’ The queen’s face softened slightly."
greneclyf_base.1.a:0 "‘I will be there. Tell her to bring that Hindian tea again.’"

greneclyf_base.2.t:0 "The Summoning of the Oireachtas"
greneclyf_base.2.d:0 "Both houses of parliament had gathered in the ancient building of the Blosmport Abbey, just as they and their predecessors had done for over 800 years. However, today's session was somewhat unusual: the Abbey, typically filled with shouting and aggressive debates during assemblies, was instead filled with excited whispers – until they were silenced by the loud strike of the gavel from Lady Chief Justice Oiren of Óir.\n\n‘Order!’ She took a deep breath and continued in her commanding manner: ‘The First Assembly of the Oireachtas under the blessed reign of Her Majesty Gytha of Leamhan is hereby declared open! The floor is given to the Monarch.’\n\nOiren directed her expectant and stern gaze at Gytha, yet only the queen, out of everyone in the hall, could see the softness and encouragement hidden within the expression of her sworn sister.\n\n‘I... Ahem. I am pleased to welcome representatives of all estates of our glorious society under one roof for the first time. A new era is the beginning of history in the making, the seeds of which the Glorious Eithne nurtured with the sweat and blood of our nation throughout her life. The time has come to reap the fruits of her labors and multiply them, without disgracing the legacy of the late queen, and for that, I, and all of us, shall exert our utmost efforts! Much work lies ahead: bringing the Guard to a state worthy of the 11th century, our people cry out for the work that was taken from them by the looms, poverty has returned to the streets for the first time since the First Great Famine,’– Gytha continued, becoming slightly more impassioned – ‘Even the Abbey! The cardinals tear at each other for the right to interpret the Matron’s word; how have we come to this!?’\n\nThe queen’s eyes met Oiren’s once more, who subtly signaled to her the need to shift the direction of her speech.\n\n‘But... but there are also things that, since the days of Eithne, function like Skyfall clocks–our new system of laws, whose Charter was written at the beginning of this century, and the introduction of the prefecture system, which has proven far more effective than the former feudal divisions. Today, as I expect, Prefect Carrion of our glorious capital will share his experience with the Oireachtas, after which we shall hear other opinions and questions, from which we shall collectively decide what path our nation must take. I sincerely thank you all.’\n\nThe representatives seated in the Abbey saw the queen off with applause as she returned to her place beside Oiren.\n\n‘Well done,’ the Lady Chief Justice whispered, allowing herself the faintest smile, before authoritatively calling out, as was custom, ‘Order!’\n\n‘The floor is given to Aphex Carrion, Prefect of Blosmport.’\n\nA stately, tall changeling of noble bearing adjusted his monocle as he stepped toward the podium and, in a creaky voice, loudly responded:"
greneclyf_base.2.a:0 "‘I thank you for this opportunity, Your Majesty Gytha, and Your Excellency Oiren.’"


# Gytha Jorney #
greneclyf_base.3.t:0 "The Journey Begins"
greneclyf_base.3.d:0 "For this special occasion, Prefect Carrion had assembled part of the city guard to hold a parade, showcasing the state of affairs in Blosmport. The general was immensely proud of himself, stretching his neck and grinning at the marching guardsmen.\n\nToday, Gytha was not merely observing the city – she was announcing the beginning of a royal tour across the entire island, a momentous event that the prefect had decided to mark with a grand display. Subjects of the crown bustled through the streets with their families, darting from one street vendor to another, while the crowd gazed in delight at the officers and reveled in the live music.\n\n‘How do you find the parade, Your Majesty?’ Carrion asked as Gytha waved a hoof at the gathered crowd.\n\n‘I must admit,’ she began, ‘the way Blosmport has transformed since my foalhood is simply breathtaking. When I was a filly, our docks had nothing but wooden boats, and now look at it – an entire shipyard, where our first vessel awaits me! Ours, not one we had to buy!’\n\nCarrion adjusted his monocle, glancing approvingly at the steel leviathan.\n\n‘Yes, Her Majesty Eithne was truly great to have introduced our people to such marvels. But I must warn you, my queen – other parts of our nation... are not as advanced. You may even find yourself shocked by how starkly the capital differs from the rest of the country,’ Carrion said, furrowing his brow.\n\nGytha shrugged. ‘Well, then I shall see it for myself, Prefect. After all, it is I who must pull this nation into an entirely new era, not someone else. And I am ready for it.’\n\nThe prefect gave a barely perceptible smile, clearly impressed by the queen’s resolve. Perhaps she was naïve, but she undoubtedly carried the potential for great deeds – if tempered with a more pragmatic approach."
greneclyf_base.3.a:0 "‘I wish you luck on your journey, Your Majesty.’"

greneclyf_base.4.t:0 "Beyond the Golden Cage"
greneclyf_base.4.d:0 "Setting hoof in Aisling for the first time, Gytha let out a surprised gasp as she descended the gangplank. Was this truly her country? This backwater?\n\n\Her thoughts were quickly interrupted by a modestly arranged welcoming ceremony, which instantly filled her heart with warmth as she saw her soot-covered miner subjects happily greeting their queen. The central figure among them was a tall changeling with a stern expression, which softened into a weary smile upon seeing the two most important figures in the kingdom.\n\n‘Your Majesty, Your Excellency – may the wisdom of the Matron light your path,’ the changeling said, bowing deeply.\n\n‘It is good to see you, Praetor Onychion. Or do you prefer your secular title of Prefect?’ Oiren asked.\n\nGytha studied his figure. ‘Onychion? You have... aged so much since we last met. It is hard to believe you are the same changeling who guided us through our initiation rites years ago.’\n\n‘Time flows, my queen. The capital’s praetor and likely next cardinal is Aktis now. As for me, I found my strength in serving here, where I am needed by our brothers and sisters in faith–not only as a priest but as a prefect,’ Onychion said, glancing at the people of Aisling.\n\nFor the next few days, Gytha and Oiren engaged in practical studies of daily life in the region. Their conversations with Onychion opened their eyes to how unevenly modernization had spread across the island–some changelings here could not even read, and the proper work of civil officials had only begun under Eithne when she appointed a priest as prefect.\n\nBidding farewell to Aisling, the queen and her entourage set forth to their next destination."
greneclyf_base.4.a:0 "Bugsmere awaits!"

greneclyf_base.5.t:0 "The Steel City"
greneclyf_base.5.d:0 "Upon arriving in Bugsmere, Gytha was met with an utterly unexpected sight: in the middle of the town square, a dense crowd had gathered around a sweating changeling, who was desperately trying to calm them down. The moment the official spotted the queen, her eyes widened in shock before she quickly spoke into the microphone again:\n\n‘Your Majesty! Bugsmere welcomes you!’\n\nThe crowd fell silent, collectively turning 180 degrees to face Gytha. She offered an awkward smile and waved at her subjects. Within moments, they began bombarding her with endless grievances:‘Your Majesty, they have taken our jobs!’ ‘We are running out of food!’ ‘Matron, have mercy on us!’\n\nBefore the bewildered Gytha could react, Oiren stepped forward and bellowed: ‘ORDER!’\n\nThe crowd instantly fell quiet. ‘I take it my home hive is not seeing its finest days,’ Oiren said, her voice calm yet firm. ‘Rejoice, then – for not only has Her Majesty arrived to inspect the situation, but so has your Lady Chief Justice. I shall gladly hear your grievances to determine the course of action moving forward. And our esteemed Prefect Berilla will assist me in this, will she not?’\n\nOiren grinned, baring her teeth at the visibly nervous official standing in the square.\n\nFor the next few days, the Queen and the Lady Chief Justice conducted thorough inspections of Bugsmere’s manufactories and mines. They listened to workers, factory owners, the prefect, miners, and even the Luddites, with whose leader Gytha shared a cup of tea – under the watchful eye of her loyal Lord Protector, Basalt Shaw.\n\nOiren’s expression betrayed nothing, but her heart ached at the sight of what had become of the House of Óir’s homeland. Basalt sensed her sorrow, taking on part of the responsibilities and speaking to the citizens in her stead to shield her from dwelling too deeply in grief.\n\nOne evening, the Lady Chief Justice visited her ancestral estate. The same respectfully bowing butler, the same lavishly adorned walls, and the same sense of order amid chaos greeted her.\n\n‘Oirie, is that you?’ a noblemare’s aged voice inquired from beside the fireplace. Her eyes opened, revealing the familiar milky haze of blindness.\n\n‘Yes, Mother... It has been a long time,’ Oiren replied, approaching her forebear. She sat beside her, allowing the elderly matriarch to embrace her daughter. After a moment of silence, Oiren spoke again: ‘How fares our house, Mother?’\n\nThe old noblemare furrowed her brow slightly, as if recalling recent events. ‘They deceive, as they always do. The elders still care for nothing but wealth and pleasure, while the young refuse to grow wise. Only your nephew, Cyanite, seems to be making something of himself – he is working his way into the prefecture, trying to serve the city,’ she said before taking a sip of her pungent herbal tonic. Then, turning her sightless gaze toward her daughter, she continued:\n\n‘You two are the last hopes for true change in this family, Oiren. Your grandmother’s rule shattered the balance, and now we are either corrupted, like Isovius – no doubt spoiling city mares as we speak...’ She let out a bitter chuckle before sighing. ‘Or we are the noble hope of our great family, like you and Cyanite. What a shame that it is Gytha who wears the crown, and not you, my beloved.’\n\nA single tear traced its way down Oiren’s face.\n\nThe following morning, as a nervously chattering Berilla and representatives of various social classes bid farewell to the kingdom’s leaders, hope for change took root in their hearts. The new generation of rulers had come – not to erase Eithne’s reforms, but to tame them and steer the nation in the right direction."
greneclyf_base.5.a:0 "The hum of the departing train faded into the distance..."

greneclyf_base.6.t:0 "The Road Home"
greneclyf_base.6.d:0 "‘I'm still surprised that for security, you only took Basalt and a couple of guards, Gytha,’ Oiren scoffed, watching the forests of Greneclyf pass by through the locomotive’s window. ‘As you can see, drones’ lives are far from ideal, and a single bitter fanatic would be enough to throw this country into a crisis beyond imagination.’\n\nGytha only smiled in response, skimming through one of the documents from Aisling. ‘Oiren, I appreciate your concern, but I’m certain my subjects won’t try to kill me. I don’t fear them – I love each and every one of them, and I want them to see that. Besides, even if some... special element were to appear among them, our ever-vigilant Lord Protector would deal with it in an instant!’\n\nA shadow of doubt darkened Oiren’s face as she searched for the right words. In the end, she just exhaled sharply.\n\n‘Gytha... do you remember the drones from Aisling? While you were speaking with Onychion about their lives, I talked to the younger ones – illiteracy is nearly universal. Our education system isn’t keeping up; there are simply too many of us now.’\n\n‘Add it to the ever-growing list of problems we need to solve,’ Gytha said with a bitter chuckle. ‘Or think of what Bugsmere has become... It pains me to see it like this. To think, once the greatest city of our nation has turned into a dusty, concrete cage.’\n\nOiren turned away, openly showing sorrow for her birthplace for the first time. But after a moment, she swallowed those emotions and looked back at the queen with a teasing smirk.\n\n‘And what happened in Llŷr? What were those shouts in the office about? Did my dear Gytha tear into someone over the poor harvest?’\n\nGytha hesitated. ‘Wicksite ... is old-fashioned, though it’s hard to say that about someone who stuffs her house with so many machines. She knows what she’s doing, she’s wise, but she needs to accept that we live in a new era. As for the harvest...’ The queen sighed. ‘I have some rather radical ideas regarding... Well, we’ll discuss that later. And on top of everything else, the peasants have started a witch hunt.’\n\nOiren gave her a questioning look but said nothing.\n\nGytha took a long sip of tea, watching as the island's landscapes were slowly swallowed by the darkness of the night.\n\n‘I’m glad you’re here, Oiren. It truly means a lot to me,’ the queen said.\n\n‘I know. We've been inseparable since we were fillies – even a royal mantle won’t get you rid of me, Leamhanie,’ Oiren chuckled.\n\n‘Yes...’ Gytha murmured dreamily, settling in more comfortably and closing her eyes in exhaustion. ‘And may it always be so.’\n\nOiren gently embraced her, lost in thought, knowing that no matter what, she would help the drowsy queen beside her make Greneclyf a place worth living in."
greneclyf_base.6.a:0 "‘Sleep well, my queen. You’ve earned a little rest.’"

greneclyf_base.7.t:0 "Graduate Report 277"
greneclyf_base.7.d:0 "‘### Top Secret, For Her Majesty's Eyes Only,’ – Gytha winced at the formality, but continued reading the yellow parchment.\n\nAfter a moment, she gently placed the sheet on the table, deep in thought. It seems the market doesn't regulate itself, and Kemerskai’s republicans were wrong – sometimes government intervention isn't such a bad thing after all.\n\n‘This Beakolini is definitely eccentric, but there's something to it,’ Gytha remarked, examining the spider from Deponya enclosed in glass."
greneclyf_base.7.a:0 "‘Perhaps we should consider adapting some of his methods.’"

greneclyf_base.8.t:0 "The Apartment of the Future"
greneclyf_base.8.d:0 "When the time came to present her project, the blue-eyed changeling beamed from ear to ear and greeted the queen with a strong Aquileian accent: ‘Bonjour, Votre Majesté! I am absolutely delighted to present to you a miniature model of a dwelling that, in the future, will be found in every corner of our glorious homeland – affordable, practical, and adorable, oui!’ the young architect chirped, nearly bouncing in excitement.\n\n‘Miss Xylocopa Valga, to the point,’ Oiren scoffed skeptically.\n\n‘Oui, oui! Please!’ Valga used her magic to lift the velvet cloth, revealing a small-scale model of a building. Gytha stepped closer, examining it.\n\n‘What... is this, dear Valga?’ asked Gytha.\n\n‘This, Your Majesty, is what in Aquileia is called construction modulaire. The idea is that such a building is not constructed on-site but assembled from prefabricated panel blocks, manufactured in advance at factories! The cost savings are simply incredible, and look!’ Xylocopa moved closer, eyes shining with excitement, and lifted the model’s roof, revealing the interior layout.\n\n‘Here, here, ma Reine, do you see? This space is fully optimized to make it as convenient as possible for future residents to handle all household tasks. Do you realize how many miles the average housewife walks while cooking stew and tending to her offspring? Naturally, it’s exhausting – but not in this kind of home, where everything is within reach,’ she laid down a blueprint, showcasing the typical apartment layout.\n\n‘The space seems quite small. I’d even say it’s bordering on uncomfortable,’ Lady Chief Justice noted. ‘Are you sure this isn’t too extreme?’\n\n‘Non, non, non, not at all! Everything is carefully calculated. Not only did I defend my thesis on this topic, but I also lived in a similar building myself. This is called rational economy, precisely what our island needs in these difficult times,’ Xylocopa flashed another dazzling smile.\n\nAfter a brief discussion and a nod from Oiren, Gytha gave her answer:"

An unexpected northern storm has devastated what little crops we had. The Sacred Grove is now forced to introduce a rationing system for food, and by my decree as Prefect, I am imposing a curfew to prevent unrest from taking root.

I fear the country stands on the brink of what happened 800 years ago...’\n\nGytha slammed her hooves on the table, huffing angrily. ‘We still have time! There’s still room to maneuver! Shaw, summon the Oireachtas immediately! Bring Oiren!’\n\nBasalt nodded, grasping the gravity of the situation, and with a curt bow, he rushed to contact the kingdom’s key officials.\n\nGytha collapsed into her chair, staring at her trembling hooves. She knew what famine was. The entire island had learned the lesson of the First Great Famine 800 years ago, ensuring that future generations would never forget the horrific images of emaciated drones, devouring each other with disgust in their eyes.

Throughout the evening’s conversations, it became painfully clear that these haughty riverland dwellers saw her kind as little more than savages – crude simpletons, easy to deceive and manipulate.\n\nDepending on them was humiliating.\n\nBy the time the dinner ended and Gytha, exhausted from endless attempts to appease those snobs, dragged herself to her chambers, Oiren once again heard her muffled sobs in the night.\n\nThat was when she swore to do everything in her power to keep the vultures from the mainland at bay."

What does that even mean?’ The queen shot a questioning look at the fidgeting mare from Bakara.\n\n‘Well, Your Majesty,’ the mare coughed and spoke cautiously, ‘in many countries of the riverlands, casinos are either banned or unregulated, turning them into breeding grounds for all sorts of unsavory elements. And so… my patrons propose that you establish the first legal casino in Saor, drawing wealth from across the entire Coalition.’\n\nOnychion, present at the meeting as Aisling’s prefect, leapt to his hooves in outrage.\n\n‘You want to open a den of debauchery and sin in our religious nation?!’ he bellowed, glaring at the trade representative, who shrank even further into her seat.\n\n‘Your Majesty, even as a representative of the schismatics, I cannot approve of this in any way. It is repulsive!’\n\n‘You think I don’t know that?!’ Gytha snapped back, slamming her hoof onto the table. ‘Spare me the sermons on the Matron, Onychion – our subjects are on the brink of eating each other! What do you expect them to survive on? Your speeches?!’ she added sharply, sinking back into her chair.\n\n‘I-I-If I may...’ the representative lifted a nervous hoof, forcing a stiff smile. ‘With the revenue from licensing fees, your treasury would see a tremendous influx of wealth – I can personally guarantee there will be enormous demand. And-and this would also make Saor far more attractive to investors and tourists!’\n\nOnychion looked like a scolded child, exhaling heavily in resignation. Meanwhile, Gytha, with a swift stroke of her quill, granted permission for the venture, then sharply lifted her gaze to the mare before her.\n\n‘What is your name?’\n\n‘S-Sweet Sprinkle,’ she stammered, adjusting her glasses.\n\n‘From now on, Miss Sprinkle, everything that happens in Saor will be your personal responsibility. Understood? Dismissed.’\n\nThe queen turned away, making it clear she had no interest in continuing the conversation.\n\nThe Bakaran's eyes widened.

How may I assist?’\n\nBasalt cast a skeptical glance at him but got straight to the point.\n\n’Captain Battler, I bring a question from Her Excellency, the Lady Chief Justice. She wishes to know why the URC has sent its own police regiment here instead of relying on the Guard.’\n\nThe captain’s smile faltered slightly.\n\n’To be honest, my lord, they simply don’t trust you,’ he said, looking directly at the changeling. ‘The official reason is security for international guests and all those vague formalities. But in truth, it’s about trust – or rather, the lack of it, eh-eheheh.’\n\n’You… are remarkably candid, Captain. While I respect that, the situation itself is troubling.’\n\nThe pony nodded in understanding, lazily eyeing the passing mares before turning back to Lord Shaw.\n\n’Your Lordship, I’ll be straight with you – I don’t care about politics. I live for three things: good drink, fine mares, and military valor. And lucky me, I can find all three right here. So, as one soldier to another, I propose friendship. I respect you as an officer respects commander, and I can assure you, I’ll keep you informed on what’s happening in Saor – off the record, of course. So long as you don’t interfere with the zone’s affairs directly. We don’t want to scare off the merchants, do we? Eh-eheheh’\n\nThe captain grinned again, but Shaw saw no malice in it. In front of him sat more of a mischievous colt than a schemer – a stallion eager to play tricks on his own superiors for reasons beyond his understanding.\n\nBasalt exhaled.\n\n’Well, given that the alternative would be storming this so-called zone with the Guard and severing ties with the Coalition, I have no choice.

Give it to the poor drones and little ones, to all who are in need – we shall continue to support you however we can.\n\nSisters’\n\nAt the bottom of the letter was a familiar symbol – one that Wicksite had seen before in reports from both the guards and the townsfolk."

And the question is pressing – who should receive it? Anticipating your question, Your Majesty, I will say this right away – Berilla and I have run the numbers. Equal distribution is impossible, and it would satisfy no one. Therefore,’ – Berilla’s protégé flipped to the next slide – ‘we have identified three target consumer groups. Group A – officials and administrators. Group B – the workforce. Group C – the lumpen.’\n\n’It would be easy to say that, in the name of harmony, we should give everything to Group C. But Your Majesty, what would be the point?’ Cyanite added, his doubt unconcealed.\n\nGytha shot him a sharp look, barely believing her ears. ‘The point is that otherwise, they will simply die, Cyanite.’\n\n’And so what?’ the deputy prefect stated shamelessly.\n\nThe queen felt a surge of anger and was about to rise, but Berilla stopped her. ‘Y-Your Majesty, allow me to explain this a little differently. Forgive my protégé for his bluntness.’\n\nThe official stood up, stepping toward the charts and slightly pushing Cyanite aside. ‘The thing is, allocating the surplus to Group A would enhance the efficiency of the administrative apparatus and speed up our recovery from the crisis. Allocating rations to Group B, our workers, would allow them to produce more, buying us some time and ensuring greater food supplies in the future. As for Group C...’ – the Prefect hesitated for a moment – ‘the only reason to increase rations for the poor is to prevent them from revolting. It is a means of pacifying the masses, but at the cost of workers and officials going hungry. Of course, there is a certain logic to that, but...’\n\n’But it is strategically smarter to increase rations for the workers and suppress the destitute with force!’ Cyanite cut in before Berilla could finish. ‘Your Majesty, you must be rational here. Please, consider everything carefully. Feed the parasites, and you risk everything else. Feed the soldiers, and they will march into Tartarus for you, eliminating threats along the way.’\n\nGytha fell silent, deep in thought.

And in the end, they’re slaughtered with no consequences,’ Oiren’s voice grew angrier with each word.\n\n’A whole nation has been turned into the riverlands’ whore.

The first – we allow Captain Battler to investigate and handle this on his own.’\n\n’And trust that they won’t cover for each other? That they won’t continue killing our kind?’ Oiren scoffed.\n\n’…Or the second option, which I offer you as a Greneclyfian. We send them a message. If you command it, Lady Oiren, I will see to it personally. Retribution will be assured.’\n\nThe Lady Chief Justice pondered. On one hoof, they could abide by the law – however foreign and imposed it may be – to keep things smooth. On the other, humiliation could not be tolerated, and every sinner against the people she swore to protect had to learn that vengeance was inevitable.\n\nAt last, she decided:"

Please come with me to the station for questioning.’\n\nThe unicorn disdainfully scanned the captain and snorted.\n\n’First of all, I have diplomatic immunity. Secondly, I don’t take orders from a filthy, common earth pony. Begone, peasant.’\n\nBattler’s smile tightened slightly. He leaned closer to the suspect’s ear and hissed,\n\n’You don’t have much of a choice, Wittenland rat. Either you come with me, or, doing a huge favor to a very, very angry royal regime, I’ll just shoot you during the arrest. This isn’t your slave-run magocracy back home. Don’t get cocky, eh-eheheh...’\n\nThe laugh sounded particularly vile to the ambassador. In the end, Shine Spark reluctantly agreed to be escorted and was soon convicted and extradited to his home country’s prison. Naturally, through connections, he could have been freed in Wittenland, but today the Saor police demonstrated that violence against Greneclyfians is also punishable by law."

Spark himself is on the upper deck, with at least four armed subjects nearby. The other twelve are scattered below. Shall we proceed?’\n\nShaw donned a balaclava and loaded his Wingbardian SMG.\n\n’We’ll make it look like a pirate attack. Remember: no witnesses. For Greneclyf!’\n\nA week later, the ship was washed ashore at Bakara, where it was inspected by the coast guard, holding back their gag reflexes at the stench of rotting bodies, shot dead and left to decay under the sun. The last to be found was Spark himself – his face frozen in a foolish expression, and a bullet hole gaping in his skull.\n\nIn light of the news, the URC declared the maritime region dangerous, reducing the flow of visitors.

She stepped out into the train vestibule to clear her head.\n\nBasalt Shaw was there as well, reading a ciphered report on regional security. Without lifting his eyes, he remarked, ‘Nervous, my lady?’\n\nGytha sighed in resignation. ‘I may be a monarch, but I still dread Wicksite’s laughter. Did Eithne really have to make her prefect?’\n\nShaw replied thoughtfully, ‘If I recall correctly, this branch of the Clann Leamhan has held these lands since Ulysses’ expedition centuries ago. It is hardly surprising that one of your relatives was chosen as prefect.’\n\n’Yes, yes... know-it-all,’ the queen grumbled.\n\nUpon their arrival, the kingdom’s dignitaries were escorted past vast fields, where peasants labored under the sun, toward a grand white manor. From a distance, it resembled a feudal estate with serfs, but in truth, the city – the kingdom’s agricultural heart – was situated just below. The manor itself served as both the administrative hub and the residence of its eccentric Prefect, Baroness Wicksite of the Clann Leamhan, known for her love of inventions.\n\nInside, Gytha instructed her retinue to wait, choosing to meet the baroness alone beyond a set of strange mechanical doors.\n\n’It has been far too long since I last saw your charming little face, darling,’ purred a slender changeling with uncharacteristically long black hair for a scion of the Clann Leamhan. A red, embroidered fan from Kiria concealed half of her face. ‘To what do I owe the pleasure?’\n\nGytha let out a nervous chuckle. ‘A kingdom-wide inspection before the reforms, Auntie. Your prefecture is the last on my list, so...’ She sat across from the pair of keen pink eyes scrutinizing her."

But why?’ Gytha asked.\n\n’Agricultural experiments by those fools who studied in Brodfeld,’ Wicksite drawled. ‘Failure after failure. But do not worry, my dear queen – I have already executed them.’\n\n’Wha–’ Gytha choked. ‘I-Isn’t that a bit extreme, Baroness?’\n\n’Not in the slightest,’ Wicksite said coolly. ‘They placed us on the brink of famine, which could lead to thousands of deaths due to their negligence. They had to pay the price.’ Her face hardened. ‘Mistakes of such magnitude must never be forgiven, my monarch. I ask that you remember this throughout your reign.’\n\nA storm of thoughts roiled in Gytha’s mind. On one hand, Wicksite’s logic had some merit – but on the other, execution for failure? These changelings had simply tried to help and failed.\n\nThe prefect set down her fan and lit a slim cigarette with a long holder. ‘Power comes with responsibility. And responsibility for a future tragedy lay on them. I will accept whatever punishment you decree for allowing this, my queen.’\n\nGytha slammed her hooves on the table, shouting at her relative, ‘Enough! We live in a new era, where noble whim no longer dictates justice! The Lady Chief Justice herself sits just outside that door, working to build a legal system where all are equal before the law! I had better not hear of any more vigilante executions, Wicksite!’\n\nThe baroness said nothing. She simply exhaled a plume of smoke and slid another paper onto the table – a hand-drawn symbol.\n\n’And this is the second piece of news,’ she murmured, closing her eyes. ‘The peasants whisper of a witch coven settling in the Sacred Grove. Likely just folklore, but my guards have discovered these symbols scattered throughout Llŷr. I will see to an investigation, but I suspect it will be a waste of time. All that truly matters is calming the peasants – reassuring them that no blasphemy lurks in our holy land.’\n\nGytha examined the peculiar sigil before tucking it away with the other documents in her satchel.\n\nWicksite opened her eyes again, watching the queen with a mix of respect and severity.\n\n’If you wish to rule a truly new kingdom, Gytha... then you must first build it.’\n\n’I will be here,’ she said, taking another drag of her cigarette."

The argument between the Prefect and the crowd was interrupted by Gytha herself, who strode forward, her gaze meeting the eyes of the loudest protester as an equal.\n\n’You wanted to speak with me.

Isn’t this what you wanted? To meet your Queen?’ Gytha’s commanding voice, now eerily reminiscent of Lady Justice Oiren, made the crowd waver.\n\nThe changeling in question stared at her, then hesitated – stammering before he found his words.\n\n’W-we will! And-and we have this!’ Hurriedly, he pulled out a bundle of papers and thrust them into Gytha’s hooves.\n\nShe unfolded them, scanning the pages before reading aloud. Then, to everyone’s surprise, she let out a chiming laugh. ‘Did you write these so-called ‘public demands’ yourself? Quite the Skynavian touch, I must say. Tell me, do you even understand a word of this?’\n\n’Queen, we love you!’ someone from the crowd shouted, and the chant spread – until Gytha raised a hoof, silencing them. Her eyes never left the protester.\n\n’Hush, hush, my friends. Instead, tell me – who put you up to this? The situation in the country is improving. You see that, don’t you? We in the Chancellery, in the Oireachtas, we are giving our all – and you see the results. Yes, it’s not a smooth process. Yes, we had to adapt. But is that truly a reason for riots and disorder?’\n\nShe turned her gaze to the rest of the crowd. ‘So say – where did this idea of revolt come from?’\n\nWhen she turned back, the loudest protester was gone – only an empty space where he once stood. She smirked. ‘Here’s what will happen, my little subjects. Go home. In a week, we’ll host a festival, and you will see for yourselves that the problems are being solved. I will be expecting you there.’\n\nAs murmurs of agreement spread through the dispersing crowd, their cheers for the Queen growing, Carrion approached her once more, adjusting his monocle.\n\n’I’m impressed.

It's not much, and it’s not the best quality, but we must take whatever we can get...’\n\n‘I completely agree, Oiren,’ came a sudden voice. In the office appeared the dark-maned Prefect of Llŷr, Baroness Wicksite in person. ‘And I’ll assist in this by sending my inventors to serve your lovely plan. The right mechanisms and extraction methods will give us both the love we need and valuable experience for further developments. What do you say, my Queen?’\n\nGytha, still sitting in her ill-fitting wedding dress, thought for a moment, but then nodded eagerly. ‘Yes! I don’t see anything wrong with this. But I ask both of you – be extremely careful. We don’t need to cause panic among the URC. You’re dismissed.’"

Individual treaties with each country will drive the kingdom into a debt trap. So, as your broker and manager of Saor, I recommend signing a compromise agreement with the URC. The URC’s stocks are stable, and even if some countries leave the Coalition, the company will remain unaffected. This will allow you to stabilize things and avoid famine.\n\n’Just... keep in mind that this isn’t charity, Your Majesty. It’s business. Everything comes with a price. But it’s better to pay less for something reliable than to squander resources, right? Even your investment in hiring me was a wise move: while my appointment as Administrator of Saor was a shock to me, it was much more tactically advantageous for you than if another corporate oligarch from the URC had sat in this chair.\n\n’So... let’s work together on solving your problems. You’re not alone.’\n\n’Gytha nodded and signed the contract expanding the United River Company’s influence in her land. Before doing so, she consulted with Oiren and secured the right for the Guard to participate in Saor's internal affairs, despite external pressure.\n\n’From this point forward, the primary driving force of Greneclyf’s economy would be a conglomerate of foreign companies."

Conspiracy cells were uncovered across the capital region. The Prefect was seething with rage – traitorous vermin had been slinking through the streets right under his nose, weaving their treacherous plots. Yet they left no room for interrogation; those who could be captured met their end by their own hooves, whether by poison or bullet.\n\nThe case files grew thick with confiscated banners, manifestos, records, and stockpiled weapons. A coup had been in the making – one orchestrated by communists eager to exploit the recent crisis as a pretext for their uprising. Their so-called party wasn’t even legally registered in the kingdom, nor did its ideas hold any footing among the citizenry.\n\nAt last, a signal officer burst into another cleared-out safehouse, speaking quickly to Carrion – the secret service had decrypted fragments of a diary belonging to one of the so-called ‘revolutionaries’. Within its pages lay an emergency contingency plan in case the insurgency was exposed.\n\nThe Praetorian Guard rendezvoused with agents at the Aisling docks. Through their binoculars, Shaw and Carrion watched as a small vessel drifted offshore. A handful of changelings stood upon its deck, staring back at them – some with their families by their sides. The general raised a hoof, ready to give the order to open fire with artillery, but the Lord Protector stopped him.\n\n’They’ve learned their lesson well, Prefect. To Tartarus with them. There’s no need for us to become child-killers.’\n\n’What about the intelligence?’ Carrion asked, still gazing through the binoculars at what had once been the greatest threat to the Crown.\n\n’We'll study it thoroughly and formulate countermeasures. One must understand the enemy and his objectives. And understand them well.’\n\nAs the soldiers and agents dispersed, a comprehensive report on Operation Crimson Dusk soon found its way to Gytha’s desk.\n\n"

Some believed the witches brought evil, others – only good, and still others denied their existence entirely, attributing the happenings to the miracles of the Matron.\n\nSmiling with satisfaction, and slowly exhaling a wisp of bluish smoke from her holder, Wicksite made her way to the last place witch activity had been reported – the edge of the Sacred Grove. \n\n‘You finally decided to show up?!’ the local priest, Xido, snapped at her with irritation. \n\n‘Watch your tone, wretch. Don’t forget who you’re speaking to.’ The baroness tilted her head coldly. ‘I am here under direct order of the Queen to investigate the actions of the witch sabbath.’\n\nThe priest winced but soon grew animated: ‘About time. There was an arson not long ago – some of the flock perished – and the marks! Damned marks everywhere! The Matron is my witness, it must be those unholy creatures!’ \n\n‘Marks..? Tell me more about the fire.’\n\nXido exhaled heavily. ‘I... I arrived when the flames were already raging.

But I ask you to set emotions aside – I am here to uncover the truth and see the guilty punished. Please, tell me what happened that night.’\n\nThe adolescent looked at the baroness with frightened eyes, searching for words. She stayed silent for a long time before finally speaking: ‘I-it was at night, two days ago. I h-heard voices behind the wall... cruel giggles... And then lightning struck our house! But not from the sky, I swear! It came from the side!’\n\nThe drone let out a sob, trying to hold back tears. ‘Papa went to see what it was, but the damned-’ Her voice cracked, and at last, emotion overtook her. ‘The damned witches burned him alive! Then they destroyed our home... They left their marks... everywhere...’\n\nWicksite calmly exhaled a ring of smoke. ‘Where exactly was your house located?’\n\nAfter hearing the answer, she nodded and made her way to the place now called The Firepit.\n\nWandering through the charred ruins, the baroness discovered mysterious signs left on the walls and floor. She studied them closely and frowned. These marks did not match the ones she had seen earlier in the letter. They were rougher, more intricate.\n\nShe returned to the priest: ‘Where are the bodies?’ \n\n‘Being prepared for burial in the cell-hey!’\n\nThe priest didn’t have time to finish. Wicksite shoved him aside and rushed into the church cellar.\n\nIn the cold darkness, she found the veiled bodies of the family. One by one, she uncovered them, carefully examining the scorched remains of her former subjects. Xido prayed behind her back, muttering about blasphemy.\n\nThe baroness rose indifferently and said: ‘I’m staying here for the night. Prepare me a bed.’"

Wicksite sprang after her at once, and the chase vanished into the forest shadows. She raced through the undergrowth, twigs snapping underhoof. Gasping for breath, the prefect finally came to a halt before an old manor. The house looked ancient, but it was clearly well cared for. A warm light glowed in the windows.\n\nThe baroness exhaled, caught her breath, and, gathering herself, pushed the door open.\n\nAnd there – she saw them.A zebra was brewing some kind of potion, cheerfully sprinkling dried herbs into it with the enthusiasm of a foal, while a batpony – the one Wicksite must have chased – rushed toward her, babbling urgently. A unicorn and a doe had paused their tea, frozen mid-sip as they stared at the unexpected guest. A pegasus with gleaming fangs kept on writing something, seemingly undisturbed. \n\n‘Oh... Is that you, baroness?’ the zebra was the first to speak.\n\nThen, casting a calming glance toward the batpony, she added: ‘Don’t worry, Nachtalina. It’s just our prefect.’\n\nWicksite slowly swept her gaze around the room. \n\n‘You...’ she narrowed her eyes. ‘You’re the ‘sisters’? The witches themselves?’\n\nThe doe smiled."

That one was drawn by our Gismirra,’ the unicorn said, walking up to the pleased-looking pegasus. ‘She designed our mark herself.’\n\nThe baroness went on, ‘And one more thing. The farmer’s family – their bodies were slashed with... something long and thin.’ \n\n‘Long and thin?’ the pegasus turned to the doe. ‘Walfreada, does that ring any bells?’ \n\nThe doe shook her head slowly.\n\n‘Purvita?’ Gismirra looked to the unicorn.\n\n‘I’ve never been one for pagan rituals, darling, forgive me,’ Purvita replied with a dismissive toss of her head.\n\n‘Demonic markings!’ Nachtalina chimed in, visibly agitated. ‘That’s what it is, Sanktella, I’m certain! The village is in danger!’ \n\nThe zebra frowned, crossing her forelegs. ‘Runes... a long killing implement...’ she muttered. ‘Sounds to me like demon-worship. A sacrifice, perhaps.’ She turned sharply to Wicksite. ‘Your Ladyship, I must ask we postpone our introductions. The village needs saving. I’ll assist you.’\n\n‘And...’ Purvita began to protest, but the zebra lifted a hoof, silencing her. \n\n‘No, girls. Stay here. The baroness and I will handle this.’\n\nThe way back passed in tense silence between Wicksite and Sanktella, broken only by the sudden, acrid scent of smoke. They picked up the pace, then broke into a full run. The prefect summoned her magic, readying a strike, while the zebra feverishly flipped through a small book of spells and ancient script.\n\nA bloody dawn met them as the village came into view: crimson skies of early morning bleeding into the black smoke of fresh fires. They reached the church and flung open its heavy doors. Corpses with twisted expressions lay in pools of their final sacrament. Dark streaks of blood fanned across the floor, soaking the tiles, trailing in thin streams down the steps, where among the slain lay hooks and handsaws.\n\nWicksite felt a wave of nausea wash over her, her certainty flickering. But Sanktella studied the carnage with a cold, steely gaze. Then she rose. The frail little body shook with a fit of soundless laughter. Empty, crazed eyes locked on the witch and the prefect.\n\n‘Briona...’ Wicksite whispered. ‘I should have known.’ \n\n‘No, Miss Wicksite.’ Sanktella’s voice was calm, but weighted. ‘A child, this is not. The demon it is, her soul devoured, forgot. I’m afraid there is no saving her now.’\n\n‘Then she can be put to rest!’ shouted the baroness, firing a blast of magic at the spasming figure. But it sprang aside like a coiled spring. The creature let out another burst of chilling laughter and, with a gesture both graceful and malformed, flung a flurry of knives toward the baroness, only for Sanktella to shove her aside just in time. The monster laughed and laughed. For the first time, the baroness trembled, feeling fear take root.\n\nBut the zebra was chanting louder and louder. Her voice rose in strength, and the creature began to seize, convulsing in response. Locking eyes with those lifeless orbs, Sanktella stepped forward, now shouting the words. With one final stride, she forced a vessel between the beast’s teeth – and when it drained, the thing let out a soul-wrenching shriek, then fell still.\n\nSanktella helped Wicksite to her hooves, and together they left the village – now a mass grave for hundreds of parishioners. After the events, the baroness ordered what remained of the settlement razed to the ground.\n\n Time passed. The Sabbath was found again – on another day, in another place.

I’ll be honest: I’m shocked.’ Gytha took a breath, looked at the witches once more, and leaned forward. ‘You... You’re all true heroines. But why have you never come forward?’\n\nPurvita sighed sadly. ‘All we ever wanted, dear Queen, was peace. Our story is long and joyless – we never sought to become heroines.’ \n\n‘Well, it’s still better than being secret mischief-makers,’ Walfreada smiled smugly. \n\n‘Besides, we don’t even have any legal grounds to be here...’ Nachtalina added wistfully. \n\n‘And some of us have, shall we say, certain... difficulties with the environment.

She murmured something in return and handed Semper a large mug filled with a fizzing liquid.\n\nSemper glanced at the translator, unsure.

But the truth was much simpler: political predictability.\n\nWhile other Coltstream Treaty countries have old nobles, fascists, communists and other psychopaths, Pònaidhean has peace, fresh air, harmony and a certain stability. And that's all you need to advance your interests in foreign lands."

No one was killed, right?’\n\n‘Unbelievable! Your insolence is matched only by your ignorance, you long-faced buffoon!’\n\n‘Ooh, what’s wrong, little changeling?’ – the politician's tirade was interrupted by a tall white pony standing in front of him, looking at Dusk with an even more arrogant look.\n\n‘You'll regret this, Miss Punch.

But now, staring at a message that spoke of a state yet unborn, of dreams wrapped in ideology and sealed with slogans, he felt a cold shiver crawl down his spine.\n\nThen, the phone rang, cutting the silence. ‘Hey, this is ‘Storm’, Pet Control. We need you on a shift tonight. 104th North Street. Owner’s upset – says her dog ran off. Grab it, bring it in. Fast and clean. The rest’ll be handled after. Don’t wake the neighbors!’\n\nTo someone else, it would’ve sounded like a wrong number. But Purple knew. They knew who they were calling. And they knew he would understand. The streets were dim. Sparse streetlights flickered. A figure in a cloak stood still by the roadside, as motionless as a statue. Just another shadow.\n\nIn the distance, headlights cut through the mist. A sleek black sedan, too luxurious for Deponya. The license plate confirmed what he already suspected: Caramel Punch, the face of Deponian nationalism. A pony who hated changelings. Who, in every interview, declared that their kind belonged in reservations, not in the Coalition.\n\nAjoite glanced at the figure. ‘Allure,’ – a nod and a soft click of a safety switch. A single shot punched into the car’s front wheel just as it entered the intersection. Screeching tires. Twisted metal. The sedan smashed through a guardrail.\n\nAjoite was there before the glass even finished falling. Already in disguise, already pulling the dazed mare from the wreck, shoving a cloth in her mouth before she could scream. With practiced precision, he bound her and turned to look at the other operative.\n\nThey were already walking over, now appearing as a traffic officer, clipboard and all. Everything was going according to plan until a shot rang out with a hoarse wheeze. No one was hurt, the dying bodyguard Punch dropped his pistol when the ‘inspector’ approached him, putting a hoof to his nose and listening to the heart-rending gurgling for a few moments.\n\nA second later, Purple disappeared into the alley, carrying on his back the politician who, just a couple of days ago, had confidently spoken of Deponya's independence. He didn't know what would happen to her. That wasn't his job. His job was to leave the ‘cargo’ where it needed to be.\n\nA week later, the country shook. Caramel Punch, the symbol of the nationalists, their voice, suddenly changed its position. Now she spoke of unity, of the need for integration, of the time to forget the past for the sake of a common future.\n\nKing Grimhoof listened. The nation listened. And Ajoite himself listened with an empty expression on his face, waiting for the next call."

All that’s missing is a touch of progress and a spark of industry – and we’re more than willing to help you with that. As friends.’\n\nCrimson was slightly touched by such blatant flattery, but kept her face. ‘Say, Gytha... I am no stranger to both friendship and trade traditions. Harmony is built on mutual exchange, so tell me, what would you ask in return for your generous help?’\n\nGytha’s face lit up, encouraged by how perceptive her counterpart was. \n\n‘Oh, nothing dramatic. Merely a formal recognition of our friendship. Isn't it a beautiful thing, when two nations can tell the world they care for one another and will watch each other’s back?’\n\nCrimson chuckled at Gytha’s reasoning, taking a deep sip of tea. ‘I like how that sounds.

Please forgive the actions’ –she glanced at the coastal patrol captain – ‘of my little ponies. You see, Greneclyf has faded into legend here. Most ponies don’t even know it exists anymore, not even in textbooks. How have you been?’ \n\n‘How have we-? Really?’ Carrion snapped, his voice heated. ‘You ask how we’ve been after your paranoid guards nearly shot us dead? What in Tartarus was that, Lady Celestia?! Where did that aggression come from?’\n\n‘Greneclyfans... a separate nation…’ Twilight Sparkle murmured in disbelief. ‘Allow me to give you a brief overview of what’s been happening on Equus over the past, um... hundred years or so.’ Twilight quickly left the room and returned with stacks of books and scrolls.

That’s why Vesalipolis aligned with those bloodsuckers, and ended up crushing the rest.

Though he could not voice it, a dark desire had grown in his mind: to drown Kerne. The old changeling’s manic obsession with fishing ignited an irresistible fury in him.\n\nStanding beside the hunched elder, he raised a stone, but then noticed something nibbling on Kerne’s line. The first catch in weeks. With a couple of deft movements, Kerne hauled in a large salmon, its head crushed by Charoite. The three silently built a fire, ate the fish, and finally found the strength to speak.\n\n’We need to tell the others.

You see, in the modern world, there are three primary naval doctrines to choose from. But the third, experimental and prohibitively expensive, should be, in my view as Rear Admiral of the Crown, dismissed outright so that we may focus on the remaining two.’\n\n‘And what, precisely, are we dismissing, Admiral?’ the Queen inquired with interest.\n\n‘The doctrine of a small, carrier-based strike force, reliant on air power. Carriers are costly to construct, and our air force is still in its infancy. Under current conditions, this strategy is neither tactically nor strategically sound.’\n\nPhi cleared his throat, encouraged by the approving nods of the realm’s key figures, and placed the two folders on the table.\n\n‘The red folder outlines a doctrine focused on refining the structure of our proud existing navy, adapting it to modern needs.

What does that contain?’\n\nPhi hesitated. ‘It presents an alternate course for naval development. Let us say... a contingency. It proceeds from the rather cautious – if not outright defeatist – premise that our fleet is insufficient for outright domination. Thus, it calls for a shift toward submarine warfare and raider tactics, striking enemy vessels from the shadows. I must confess, I find this strategy distasteful – not merely out of wounded pride, but because of its assumptions. The main resource hubs of our potential adversaries lie inland, and thus, delivering a decisive blow would be difficult.

Your Majesty. We face a question of grave consequence: What should form the bedrock of our army? The answer is plain: we need a strong, disciplined, and numerous regular force built upon mandatory military service.’\n\n‘First: the safety of the realm cannot rely on a handful of elite warriors. Wars are won by armies, not by heroes. We must be certain we have thousands of trained hooves ready to defend our borders. Second: conscription shall forge a stronger nation. Military service is a school of discipline, unity, and civic spirit. One who serves becomes not merely a soldier, but a patriot, prepared to rise when the realm is in danger.’\n\n‘We cannot entrust national defense to a narrow circle of chosen few. We need a nation under arms, not a court of privileged knights. I urge you to support the doctrine of a regular army and the establishment of mandatory conscription. Only thus can we guarantee our people’s safety and our Kingdom’s sovereignty.’\n\n‘Your view is noted, Prefect. Your time.’ With that, Oiren struck the gavel, prompting Carrion to bow and withdraw. ‘The floor now recognizes General of the Leib Guard, Bermondt Latreau.’\n\nTo the podium stepped a striking figure in the black uniform of his regiment, its insignias sharp and unmistakable. He removed his peaked cap and held it high in salute. ‘Honored Deputies. Beloved Queen. The world has changed, but so has war. This is no age of numbers, but of precision. The army of tomorrow is made not of ranks, but of elite, highly trained, rapid-response units. They strike fast, strike true, and complete missions that regular infantry can barely comprehend.’\n\n‘Elites bring results: measured, surgical, effective. A regular army is a lumbering mass that must be fed, clothed, and armed. It is a burden on the bureaucratic core of the kingdom, and with it comes corruption, mismanagement, and stagnation. Modern conflict is no longer about endless frontlines. It is special operations, sabotage, speed. Who is more suited: an elite who has trained for years, or a conscript barely able to hold a rifle? Discipline cannot be beaten into the unwilling. In every conscripted herd lies the thug, the coward, the traitor. My doctrine leads to victory, not to wasteful loss.’\n\nWith both sides heard, the chamber moved to a vote. The deciding voice belonged to Lord Shaw, who chose..."

Mad kings and dictators in other nations will come to the same conclusion sooner or later. If we don’t want them to destroy our homeland, we must at least have the appearance of balance.

But let’s get to the point,’ he said, suddenly serious.\n\nGytha stopped stirring her tea and looked him straight in the eye. ‘Where does your loyalty lie, Adler?’\n\nThe agent hesitated, unsure how to answer. ‘Can you guarantee my safety, no matter what I say?’\n\n’Answer me, Adler. I swear, no harm will come to you.’\n\nHe set his cap on the table and exhaled. ‘I’m loyal only to my sister, and to Ditrysium. Believe me, I feel no love for Thorax and his gang... but I hold no special reverence for Chrysalis either.’\n\nHe smirked. ‘So, there you have it – I’ve just told the leader of a foreign nation I’m not loyal to my queen. You can turn me in and enjoy the show when they line me up against the wall.’\n\n’Relax. I told you, no one’s going to touch you. On the contrary, I’m glad you said that. It means we’re aiming in the same direction. It pains me to see the hives in this state, and I truly want to help our kind.’\n\n’You’re planning a coup? An intervention?’\n\nGytha struck her hooves against the table. ‘I’m planning to kick down the door and bring the rotten façade down with it. For harmony, for peace – and for your sister as well. Please, I need your help. I can’t do this alone.’\n\nAdler looked away. ‘If anything happens to Helvia...’\n\n’It will, if Chrysalis stays in power, Adler,’ Gytha said gently, turning his face back to hers. ‘But if we act, Helvia could rise to become the new queen. She’s smart. She can lead’\n\nAdler placed a hoof on hers and held her gaze for a long moment. Then he nodded. ‘Alright, Madam President. I’ll see what I can do.

Unmarked changelings stormed the compounds in waves, dragging terrified Vesalipolian officials from their beds; in some districts, shots were exchanged. The armed raiders were soon joined by nobles and changelings in VOPS uniforms, overseeing arrests and dispersing stunned civilians.\n\nMoments later, speakers across the city – and every home radio – crackled to life. A voice began to speak:\n\n’Dear citizens, beloved subjects.\n\nAfter deep reflection on the world around us and the conditions in which our Hives now live, I have made a decision. The situation demands extraordinary measures.\n\nIt is true: Chrysalis declared war in the name of our survival. And now she leads us to a fleeting triumph that, in truth, races toward ruin. Her goals are irrational. Victory means nothing if it ends in the extinction of our kind beneath pony hooves.\n\nShe has forgotten that the crown exists not for her lash, but in service to the people. She already led us to disgrace in the year 1002. If we do not rise now, we will lose both our honor and our country. This second war may not be another defeat – it may be our erasure.\n\nWe are children of the same soil. But does a mother lead her children to death again and again? Faith in strength must not become faith in madness. A ruler who cannot retreat will, in the end, lose everything.\n\nToday, we must ask: how do we save millions of our kin without dooming ourselves to shame?\n\nThe thought of all those officers and soldiers – those who fell in battle, who died at their posts, or in other ways – and of their grieving families, it breaks our hearts day and night.\n\nI call upon our most honorable army: stand beneath the banner of Ditrysium. Prevent the catastrophe that awaits us if we follow that pride-drunk mare in Vesalipolis and her lapdogs, like Trimmel.\n\nGather your strength, not for conquest, but for rebuilding. Let our nation, like one family, hold firm to the idea of unity and bear with dignity the heavy burden of responsibility laid upon our young state – one that still has far to go. Walk the path of justice, of nobility of spirit, and serve with the belief that you may yet raise our kind to eternal glory.’\n\nAs Helvia’s speech faded, a melody began to play on every station – one not heard in years. The old anthem of Ditrysium, now rising over the airwaves, mingled with the blare of air-raid sirens and the roar of fighters taking off into the night sky. Many wept."

And of course,’ Gytha added, her eyes barely leaving Adler’s, ‘I come with generous loan offers for your kingdom.’\n\nSeeing the way they looked at each other, and hearing that word ‘loan’ Helvia grew even more despondent. A loan. For rebuilding what she, the president, had helped destroy.\n\n’Full aid. No loans. My subjects have paid in blood.

I’ve learned a lot over my career. And one thing above all: who someone is matters far less in politics than it does in novels. Chrysalis had a cabinet. But Synovial’s cabinet – that’s our cabinet. It’s run by our agents. Our elites. Underneath his charming nationalist regime, it’s Harmonists pulling the strings. And we’ll teach them the right way in time. We just can’t push them now.

Tartarus take it, I swear I’ll do everything I can to preserve peace – to save the kin we still have back home. That’s how this coalition with Synovial will work. Oiren, just think about it.

You’re feared only by those who truly understand your power. Maybe that’s what you want from me too,’ she laughed, her eyes seeming to pulse with manic light. ‘I hate you for tearing my world apart, but I can’t help but admire what you’ve built. Maybe it’s turning into obsession. You’re brilliant, Gytha. You have given them the idea that changelings will rule them and they will be happy about it.’\n\nGytha’s face twisted. ‘We are not alike. Why am I even wasting my time on a deranged old hag? I don’t know why I didn’t hand you over to the Equestrians. But it doesn’t matter now. Enjoy your eternal vacation.’\n\nThe president turned and left the prison, the echoing laughter of that proud madmare still lingering in her mind.

Both events are of great significance to both nations. \n\n Known collectively as the \"Great Treaties,\" these masterpieces stand as testimony to the historic friendship and cooperation between the two peoples. They blur biological barriers and prove the universality of the idea of harmony."

NCH_idyllic_society_1_desc:0 "As changelings, the people of Greneclyf are naturally inclined toward military affairs and, during Eithne’s reforms, eagerly sought information and knowledge about the state of armies across the Griffonian continent. However, the kingdom has long lived in isolation, maintaining contact only with a handful of tribes, and as a result its populace is far from warlike in spirit."

Gagat, became the first printing house on the island to mass-produce press materials for civilians. This thin morning newspaper, rolling off the presses of Blosmport, is capable of influencing stability in the hives and shaping the mood of vast masses in line with the promoted agenda—something that should never be underestimated. \n\n Naturally, work on any given commission will require certain investments."

NCH_fed_found_category_desc:0 "Greneclyf is presented with a historic opportunity to unite the Riverlands under a single banner and create a new nation. Under the leadership of Gytha, determined to achieve her goal at any cost, the kingdom must carefully balance between the carrot and the stick, while keeping in mind the competing project of the River Federation—one that extremist elements may exploit, driving our allies beneath the boot of tyranny."
